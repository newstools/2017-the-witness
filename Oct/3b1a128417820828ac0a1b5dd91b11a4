Pietermaritzburg's own “Rambo” has placed first in South Africa’s National Amateur Body Building Association championships. Pieter Oelofse (51), a well-known security guard at the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court, was awarded first place in the Nabba (National Amateur Body Building Association) WFF (World Fitness Federation) championships on Saturday in the Masters category for over 50 year olds. Born and bred in Pietermaritzburg, Oelofse started his career in body building 25 years ago after his love for playing rugby left him with one too many injuries. Known to many as “Rambo” because of his size and build, the gentle giant said although he had trained hard and maintained a strict diet he had not expected to win. “It felt good that I made the top spot. I was very happy,” he said. Oelofse was placed first in the KZN regional Nabba WFF in September this year, where he was selected to compete in the national championships. The body builder entered his first body building competition in 1997, where he also placed first. Growing up, Oelofse said he never expected to be competing as a body builder. He said nowadays he is often approached by people who are surprised to see a man over 50 “looking so good and still competing”. Oelofse said that he will continue to enter body building competitions until he is unable to do so. Oelofse said he trains every day for an hour-and-a-half and is willing to assist aspiring body builders for free.
