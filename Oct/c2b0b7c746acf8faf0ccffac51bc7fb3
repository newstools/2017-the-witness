If you thought shoddy work was to blame for manholes being covered by tar on the city’s roads, you’ve got it wrong. That’s according to the City who on Thursday said they had planned to do this for smoother driving.  A number of manholes along Boshoff Street in the city centre have been covered by what is widely believed to be tar during the recent refurbishment of the road. When The Witness drove along the road on Thursday, some manholes were found to be completely covered while some are partially covered.  A motorist alerted The Witness to the recent work done on the road, saying contractors or municipal employees may have inadvertently covered the manholes in what he believed was a show of shoddy workmanship.  At first, it was believed that perhaps municipal employees tried to “cover up” poor work that may have been done by contractors or that this may have been the work of the contractors themselves.  But, surprisingly, when approached to comment, Msunduzi municipal spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said that it was the City’s intention to cover up the manholes in this way to save vehicles from being damaged.  She said that covering the manholes with the material would ensure smooth driving for motorists, and she added that they were looking at a permanent solution to raise the manholes to road surface level. “This is the temporary measure to prevent damage that may be caused to vehicles travelling on these roads,” she said.  When asked if the municipality would have to break through the tar to get to the manholes should the need arise, Mafumbatha said that the material used was not tar. “This is a reusable material that can be removed easily in the event of operational requirements,” Mafumbatha said.
