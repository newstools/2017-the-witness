Scottsville residents are pleading with the municipality to fix street lights and say that the darkened streets are encouraging thieves.Former ward committee member and resident in the area Louise van Staden said that the lack of street lights has led to continued burglaries on Milborrow Road.  “The vagrants living in the Old Scottsville Bowling Club, opposite Scottsville Primary School, are part of the problem,” Van Staden said. The school has had bags of recycling material worth thousands of rands stolen from its grounds. Van Staden said the school had reported the problem to the municipality “repeatedly”. “There are three light poles from the corner of King Edward and Milborrow roads, adjacent to Scottsville Primary School, that are all out. This is leading to ... burglaries almost every week. Some serious, some not so serious,” she said.  She said that the thieves had “some sort of transport” as they stole five big bags. Each of the bags weighs about a ton when full of glass.  “These recyclable items are worth at least R 5 000 that was meant to go towards school funds,” Van Staden said.  She said there was also a break-in at another property where garden tools were stolen. “These unrepaired street lights are a stark reminder of Msunduzi Municipality’s inefficiency,” she said.
