Residents from a block of flats on Peter Kerchhoff Street launched a clean-up campaign this weekend that is set to encourage the reduction of crime and litter within the CBD. The residents cleaned out an old pathway off Burger Street that connects the CBD to the Duzi River and surrounding park. The campaign was spearheaded by local resident Sam Groves after starting a Facebook group where he invited others to clear the alien vegetation and the litter from the pathway. “I come through this area almost every day and I’ve been struck by how littered it is. The alien vegetation has completely taken over and it has driven away all of nature’s goodness. The big trees are being overrun with alien vines, making it an ideal place for commuters to be mugged.” The residents collected refuse from the pathway and put it into plastic bags. Groves, who has been staying in the area for two years, said he started the project with his five children and they pulled down the alien vines. “I realised it was too much work for a few people. Using the power of Facebook I decided to pull together a work party and got 30 volunteers. This is a beautiful part of the city and it’s been destroyed, we wanted to be proactive.” He said there was a long-term plan to have the area designated a conservancy. “We want to put signs up and keep this area clean,” he said. “The dumping is done by people who live here. We are talking to residents to try and keep this area clean. “We live in a block of flats and there are children there. This area is a park; it should be a clean and safe place for children to play. We are trying to re-utilise the basketball court as well.”
