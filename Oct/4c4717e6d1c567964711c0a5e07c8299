Residents around the Richie Road dump have criticised those who are dumping refuse outside the gates of the garden refuse site.  But the residents said they are also left with no alternative as the gates to the dump are always locked.  “It is terribly untidy and the wind is not helping the situation. It gets worse each day. Surely if the gates of the dump site are closed there should be an appointed security guard to stop the unsightly dumping of household and garden refuse outside the gate,” said one of the frustrated residents. She has since written to ward councillor Vic Winterbach, who has also reported the matter to the municipality.  Residents said the situation worsens daily as rubbish piles up and the gusty spring winds distribute the rubbish and stench throughout the neighbourhood.  “It really bothers me that so many people are looking for work and the municipality are not putting together a team for a weekly area clean-up.  “Pietermaritzburg is really going down as one of the most littered cities. As far as I’m concerned there is a complete disregard for our once so very beautiful city. It takes nothing but dignity for each and every person to do their part and keep their city clean,” the resident urged.  She said it was very sad that residents and the municipality did not care for their area anymore. “What kind of place are we creating for our children to grow up in?” she asked.  Winterbach said that this was an ongoing “burning” issue and is fast becoming a health hazard.  “We desperately need an intervention as repeated requests to the waste unit have been unsuccessful,” he said.  Winterbach said he and other councillors have constantly called for additional skips and other equipment to be supplied at the garden refuse sites. “Promises were made by the municipality in that regard but, regrettably, to date nothing has transpired. The site really needs to be better managed,” he said.
