Four children at a local school were allegedly jabbed with a syringe by a classmate this week.  The mother of one of the pupils at the township school said she was “panicking” after being told that her seven-year-old daughter was one of the four. Her daughter said she was in her Grade 2 classroom when a boy in her class started walking around the class jabbing the needle at children.  “Apparently he had already pricked four children before the teachers intervened,” she said. The mother said the teachers rushed the pupils to the local clinic on Thursday, but they were told that the pupils could not be treated without their parents being present. “The teachers dropped my daughter at home and explained the situation to my sister as I was at work.” On Friday she, the teachers and the other parents went to the clinic with the pupils. This incident comes shortly after news reports revealed that at least 28 Gauteng school pupils had to receive urgent antiretroviral (ARV) treatment as a precaution after three Grade 4 pupils pricked them with syringes last week. KZN Department of Education spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi said the department was not aware of this particular incident as yet but a similar incident had been reported in Durban recently. “Right now it is a matter to be investigated by the police. The police need to investigate where these syringes came from and how the children accessed them. “It is a matter that is worrying us as the Department of Education. We will launch our own investigations.”
