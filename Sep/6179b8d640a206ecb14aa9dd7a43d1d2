&ldquo;I was provoked and I will not stand for it.&rdquo;That was the response from former Msunduzi deputy mayor and member of the National Assembly Mervyn Dirks after a picture of him sticking up his middle finger started circulating on WhatsApp on Thursday afternoon.The TV screenshot was taken during President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s question and answer session in Parliament, which got off to a fiery start.When The Witness contacted Dirks, he first denied that it was him in the picture, saying it was a &ldquo;very bad Photoshop [manipulation]&rdquo;. However, he later admitted that it was indeed him in the picture and that the middle finger was directed at members of the DA.Dirks said he was irked after members of the DA deliberately butchered his surname and called him d***.&ldquo;I showed them the middle finger because they are extremely racist. They are white and Afrikaner and know very well how to pronounce my surname. My surname is Dirks and they can pronounce it.&rdquo;Dirks said he was upset that he was called a d*** in the chambers.&ldquo;It is totally unacceptable. They were provoking me by pronouncing my surname wrong and I told them where to get off.&rdquo;DA KZN deputy leader Mergan Chetty condemned the act as &ldquo;immature&rdquo;.&ldquo;This conduct by a Member of Parliament is unacceptable. What message is he sending out to the youth? Is this the type of leaders the ANC has?&rdquo;Chetty said he hopes the ANC will discipline Dirks and order him to apologise publicly.
