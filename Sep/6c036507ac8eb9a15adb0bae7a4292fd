&ldquo;I don't like the limelight and I don&rsquo;t like to be noticeable &mdash; I like to be reachable,&rdquo; says Warrant Officer David Pillay. The 59-year-old married father of three is a veteran member of the SAPS K9 Dog Unit whose passion lies in service to the community by feeding the needy, and keeping children away from drugs and alcohol. It all started with his soccer team, Maritzburg Sporting. &ldquo;It started about 18 years ago, I started taking children off the street and teaching them about the effects of drugs and alcohol. &ldquo;I got a local printer to print my phone number on my bakkie so that if someone has an alcohol or drug-related problem my phone number is there &mdash; they can call at all hours.&ldquo;The response was tremendous. There is definitely a need for drug rehabilitation within our communities. &ldquo;Then about two years ago, I got a few people together to start making food hampers. &ldquo;I went to many businesses to ask for their help, I bought a market card out of my own pocket and started buying fruit and vegetables. Some of them [at the market] surprisingly offered to help with produce here and there. &ldquo;I started off with seven hampers &mdash; now we do 32 every month. &ldquo;These are really poor people and most of our beneficiaries are 75 and older. One family had no table at their house to put groceries on. &ldquo;In one family, who were relocated from Gauteng to Pietermaritzburg, the wife is working and she spent her entire salary on rent. I asked her how she provided for their child and she said just by God&rsquo;s grace.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady who we&rsquo;ve given bedding and a stove to &mdash; they have about seven living in their house.&ldquo;My greatest happiness is when you walk into a home and they say, &lsquo;Our life saver is here&rsquo;. It brings so much joy to me. I&rsquo;m like a little boy when I do the hampers. &ldquo;I was amazed one time when this aunty had actually cooked curry and put it in a container and said &lsquo;Son, this is for you&rsquo;. She insisted I take it. I was so thrilled. &ldquo;These are the things that give me that drive.&ldquo;My father, Kistensamy Dorasamy Pillay, is my inspiration &mdash; he was a real community man. I used to see, when he gave bread to families, he used to do it with so much passion.&rdquo;
