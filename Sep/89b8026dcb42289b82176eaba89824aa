Local police have warned schools to be extra vigilant about who they allow onto school premises. This comes after three young men, dressed in school uniforms, were removed from Siyahlomula Secondary School in Edendale on Wednesday by police. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said the police were called to the school after the three men, posing as pupils, were removed from a classroom and detained by the school. “They entered the school and went into one of the classrooms and started verbally insulting the pupils,” he said. Ngobese said the pupils reported the men to the teachers and they were detained by the school and the police were called in. “The three men were wearing school uniforms. They claimed they were pupils from a nearby school but investigations revealed that they were lying. “They later said they had obtained the uniforms from relatives,” said Ngobese. He said they were later released with a warning. Ngobese referred to a recent incident that happened in Ekurhuleni, Gauteng, where a primary school’s deputy principal was shot dead in his office by people pretending to be electricians. “We appeal to school principals, teachers and school security guards to be extra vigilant to prevent criminals, rapists and drug dealers from entering school premises undetected,” he said.
