A 40-year-old alleged cocaine dealer, Moses Mncwabe of Pietermaritzburg, appeared in the magistrate’s court on Tuesday in connection with a number of charges. Mncwabe, who has not yet pleaded to any of the charges, was represented by advocate Martin Krog. Mncwabe faces two counts of corruption in connection with an alleged R1 million bribe offered to the police officers who arrested him last week, Sergeant Leroy Boucher and Warrant Officer Jay Marian. It is alleged in the state’s charge sheet that he offered to pay the officers R1 million to “make the criminal case against him go away”. He is further charged with dealing, alternatively with possession, of cocaine to the total value of R174 000. According to the charge sheet, he was found in Ohrtmann Road on September 22 with 330 g of cocaine valued at R99 000, 14 jaws of rock cocaine valued at R21 000 and 180 plastic bags of cocaine worth R54 000. Cash to the value of R99 490 was also allegedly recovered from his vehicle, the charge sheet states. His advocate yesterday questioned why the state wanted to postpone the case until next week for a formal bail hearing, saying that the investigating officer, Captain J. D. Singh, had “ample time” to verify information such as where he lives because Mncwabe is a local. “My instructions are to forcefully oppose the application [for a remand],” said Krog. However after consulting Singh, the prosecutor, Ally van Heerden, said the police still have to check on other properties and assets owned by Mncwabe and the state needs this information before his bail application. After considering the matter, magistrate Bessie du Preez adjourned the case until October 4 for a formal bail hearing. Mncwabe was remanded in custody until then. He left the dock to return to the cells smiling and briefly waving to some supporters in the public gallery.
