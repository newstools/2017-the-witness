The Pelham Primary School choir has put the city on the map after scooping a national award at the Sing in Harmonie National Choir Competition in Gauteng, on Sunday night.  The choir, consisting of 67 members, entered the Sing in Harmonie National Choir competition and made it through the first round which was held in Newcastle.  Pelham principal Lorrel Wissing said they won the Best Micro School Award, which was the best achievement in the section of choirs from schools with fewer than 600 pupils, beating 10 other schools of the same size. “This is the first time Pelham has ever entered [the Sing in Harmonie Competition] and the pupils did so well and were superbly behaved.” She said one of the pupils had to step up and conduct the choir in front of an audience of about 4 000 people after the choir master could not conduct because of where the organisers had placed the piano.  “We are so proud of them. Our theme for this year is ‘shine’ and that we did,” said Wissing. A proud mother of one of the choir members, Tanya Dryden, told The Witness that she could not sit still on Sunday night after hearing that the school had won an award. “I cannot explain in words how proud we are.  “This small little school from PMB took over the casino dome and rocked it to the hilt,” she said.  Sing in Harmonie is a programme of Kyknet Nou on DStv’s channel 146 where school choirs are given a platform where they can compete on national television and expose them to the broader communities of South Africa, as well as promote their choirs.
