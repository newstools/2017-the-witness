A day out playing together took a tragic turn for two cousins when one of them drowned in an animal dip tank. Six-year-old Ayabongwa Nzama from Snathing, Edendale drowned on Thursday after he was allegedly pushed into a plunge dip by another child. The Grade R pupil had been out playing with his cousin, Lwandle Kheswa, when they met the other child. According to ER24, search and rescue teams recovered the boy’s body from the plunge dip, commonly used to immerse livestock in liquid pesticide. Paramedics declared the boy dead on the scene. Ayabongwa’s uncle Philani Kheswa, said they had no idea that he had gone to the plunge dip. “We thought he was out playing with his cousin near our home,” he said. Kheswa said neighbours told them that the three had been spotted 200 metres away from his house sliding down a hill. “One of the neighbours said he reprimanded them because they were playing next to a busy road. He feared they may get knocked by passing cars.” The three then allegedly went up the hill to the plunge dip.  Kheswa said Lwandle told them that the other child pushed Ayabongwa into the narrow channel.  Lwandle watched helplessly as his cousin disappeared under the dark water. “We were alerted by a neighbour who saw Lwandle running down the hill crying. Lwandle told him that his cousin fell into the water and did not come up.” “We went to the dip and tried to pull him out but it was too deep. It was dangerous, so I jumped out and waited for the police to rescue him. Unfortunately when they arrived it was already too late.” Ayabongwa remained submerged for approximately two hours. Only the sandals he was wearing were floating in the water. Kheswa said the entire family was devastated by Ayabongwa’s death. Plessislaer police station spokesperson Captain Musa Ntombela said an inquest docket had been opened.
