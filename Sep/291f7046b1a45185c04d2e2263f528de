Communication Workers’ Union (CWU) members working at Post Offices have vowed to continue their strike until their demands are met.  Striking workers who are demanding a wage increase of 12%, among other things, demonstrated outside the central Post Office in the CBD on Thursday morning.  They have been on strike since Tuesday. CWU Pietermaritzburg shop steward Julia Mzobe said they held a meeting with Post Office officials in Durban earlier this month.  She said the Post Office refused their demands of a 12% increase.  “The employer is offering a zero percent increase,” said Mzobe. “There are part-time workers that have been working for the Post Office for over a year now. We have asked the employer to give them permanent contracts but they refused,” she said. The workers are also demanding an increase in housing allowances and want the Post Office to provide transport whenever they have to attend funerals of their colleagues. CWU provincial secretary Thami Mzeleni said the provincial top brass had also had a meeting with the Post Office, where workers’ demands were refused.  South African Post Office (Sapo) group CEO Mark Barnes said they have contingency plans in place to ensure there is a minimum impact on service delivery. He assured the public that all Post Office branches will be open for business. “Sapo received a funding injection in 2016, and that was largely used to settle long outstanding creditors as well as unresolved wage commitments to the employees thus contributing to the stability of our labour relations,” said Barnes. “While we have steadily progressed well, Sapo’s revenues have not increased as anticipated, making it difficult to fund salary increases in the current negotiating cycle,” he said. He said Sapo’s management remains committed to working together with unions towards a long-term sustainable solution that will be beneficial to all parties concerned.
