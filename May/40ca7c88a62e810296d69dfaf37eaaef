A man was killed and two others injured after an alleged drunken fight broke out early on Wednesday morning at the corner of Boom and Pine streets.Residents swarmed the area, kept back by the yellow police tape as paramedics attended to the two injured men while police asked questions.It is alleged that the three men had been drinking at a shebeen on Boom Street on Tuesday night and continued to drink on the street after the shebeen closed up.A resident who did not want to be named said she heard a man shouting &ldquo;give me your money&rdquo; several times just after 7 am. She said when she came outside a few minutes later, a man was lying dead a few metres from her home and two other men nearby were bleeding from the head and stomach.It is thought that the three men knew each other and that after a night of drinking, the one man tried to steal money from the other two men.The man allegedly stabbed his two companions, one in the stomach and the other in the head.Residents in the area said the two injured men retaliated, hitting their attacker multiple times in the head with a concrete brick. He was declared dead at the scene when paramedics arrived later that morning. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said the two men who were stabbed in the fight sustained moderate injuries, and were transported to Edendale Hospital.One resident who would not be named said he had known the man who had been killed and said he lived downtown and was 31 years old.The resident who had heard the initial fight said that crime along Boom Street had increased after the closure of the Ematsheni Beer Hall.She said those who had used the hall were coming up to Boom Street to drink at the two shebeens that were situated there.&ldquo;They are all coming here and making this street unsafe,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;They rob people and then duck in between the houses and trees and run off.&ldquo;When they try to come into my home, I boil a pot of water and throw it on them. I do not want to be scared in my own home,&rdquo; she said.Another man who would not be named said he had been attacked two weeks ago by three men who robbed him and said he believed the men had come to the area following the closure of the beerhall.Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said a case of murder had been opened as well as a two cases of assault with intention to do grievous bodily harm.Ngobese said the matter was being investigated and that police would be watching the area closely for criminal activity.
