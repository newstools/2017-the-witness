The IFP in the KZN legislature has lambasted the Freedom Day celebrations, calling it a waste of public funds.The IFP leader in the provincial legislature, Blessed Gwala, questioned whether there was anything to celebrate after &ldquo;such huge spending of public funds&rdquo;.The national Freedom Day celebrations were held in Manguzi, north of the province, and were addressed by President Jacob Zuma.&ldquo;When our government hosts so-called Freedom Day celebrations, we see the hypocrisy of these events that turn out to be just song, dance and empty political rhetoric that fall on the noisy gathered masses like infertile seeds on open fields,&rdquo; said Gwala on Friday during the debate on Freedom Day celebrations held at the legislature.&ldquo;One needs to ask what was achieved after such huge spending of public funds?&ldquo;What was the message that our government gave to the people?&ldquo;Was it a message that said freedom has arrived now after 23 years and you can now live in a decent house with electricity and clean water?&ldquo;Was the message that you now have job security and your families can live in peace free from crime?&ldquo;Was the message one of hope that there will be economic growth driven by a government that has visionary leadership?&rdquo; asked Gwala.DA MPL Mbali Ntuli said South Africans have freedom, but they cannot use it, because of a lack of opportunities.&ldquo;We have political freedom and we have some protection from abject poverty through our social welfare system. Where we fall incredibly short though, is the ability for citizens to use their freedom to access opportunities that can fundamentally change their lives.&ldquo;The easiest way of doing this would be to acquire a good education and then to have an environment that could absorb that workforce.&ldquo;South Africa fails dismally short on both of these. Not only is our education system in a shambles, but there is no economic growth whatsoever,&rdquo; she said.
