It was a long time ago but I still remember the good friends and the good times we had in the world,&rdquo; said an emotional Robinson.He said he joined the war because he was anti-Nazi.&ldquo;I did not hate the Germans but I hated the things that Adolf Hitler had done.&ldquo;When the war ended we were happy as it meant the end of casualties. We lost a lot of people,&rdquo; he said.Pennington said he was proud of his contribution to the war. &ldquo;We were so distressed about the things that Hitler was doing and we wanted to stop him. &ldquo;We saw the scariest things in the war and some of our friends suffered post-traumatic depression and they never recovered,&rdquo; Pennington said.
