Presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma steered clear of the succession debate while speaking at the launch of a municipality named after her, but her supporters did not.Though the ANC national office has canned the succession debate in the build-up to its December conference, ANC members in Harry Gwala could not help themselves in throwing into the hat the name of the former AU chairperson for the presidential race.Dlamini-Zuma is expected to battle it out at the ANC conference with Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed Zuma.Yesterday she was in her home region, Harry Gwala, attending the launch of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma Local Municipality, which is the merger of Ingwe and KwaSani local municipalities.&ldquo;Come December 2017, as this region, we will put forward your name to lead the organisation,&rdquo; said Harry Gwala District Municipality deputy mayor Ntuseni Duma.&ldquo;We will not put forward her name just because she is the president&rsquo;s ex, but because of her role in the ANC. She is an ANC member who joined the ANC with her own R20 like all of us.&ldquo;We must make it clear, as women we are ready to lead. We have been ready since 1994,&rdquo; she said.On the logo of the new municipality, the image of Dlamini-Zuma towers above mountains, which her supporters said they hope would happen in the presidential race.Taking to the podium, Dlamini-Zuma, who has been criss-crossing the country lately in what has been seen as campaigning for the ANC top job, made no reference to the upcoming conference.She said naming of the municipality after her while she is still alive, puts her under pressure to avoid going astray.&ldquo;Usually institutions are named after people who have died already. Now this puts me under pressure, if I go astray, you will have to change the name of the municipality,&rdquo; she said.
