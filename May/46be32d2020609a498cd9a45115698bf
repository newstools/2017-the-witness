A 78-year-old man is nursing a fractured finger and numerous bruises after he fell on a broken concrete pavement on Church Street. Douglas Devan also broke his tooth in the fall. His son Rajan Devan said the municipality has failed to repair the broken concrete for two months and after numerous calls and e-mails &ldquo;there is still no response from the municipality&rdquo;.Devan said he was walking on Church Street, between Thomas and Knipe streets, when he tripped on the broken concrete paving slabs. &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s tooth came out and he grazed his shoulder and knee. His forehead is also badly hurt,&rdquo; said Rajan. He said his father was diabetic and any injury was a severe one. He called on the municipality to prioritise the upgrade of the downtown area and fix all broken concrete slabs on the pavement.&ldquo;There are hundreds of people who walk these streets and as much as road surfaces are smooth for vehicles to drive on, so the sidewalks that people walk on should be,&rdquo; he said. Msunduzi Municipality did not respond to a query regarding the broken pavements in the CBD.
