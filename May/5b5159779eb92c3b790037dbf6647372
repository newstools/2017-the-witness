I&rsquo;m totally stoked and I know this win is going to push me to do better so I can keep winning,&rsquo;&rsquo; the visibly elated pupil told The Witness .The competition is an initiative to enhance recreation and development at schools through play and sport.The 12-year-old will be representing the school in soccer and in volleyball at the District Volleyball Championships later in the week. When asked whether he found it difficult to balance sports with school work, the ambitious pupil said: &ldquo;No, because when I&rsquo;m in class I focus on my school work and the same applies when I&rsquo;m out on the field. Somehow I do find balance between the two because they are both important in my life,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.His sports hero is Neymar, who plays as a striker for Spanish giants Barcelona in the La Liga. &ldquo;I like Neymar because he didn&rsquo;t have it all when he started but worked hard to get where he is. What I admire most about him is his strength that pushed him to be among the world&rsquo;s best players today. I also wish to play professional soccer in the premier league,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said.Lethukuthula and other monthly winners receive a Let&rsquo;s Play hamper filled with goodies to the value of R700, as well as an opportunity to be featured in the newspaper.Sports coach Rizae Pillay described Lethukuthula as a &ldquo;very passionate child who has the ability to achieve great success in sport&rdquo;.&ldquo;We are very excited that he is this month&rsquo;s winner [April],&rsquo;&rsquo; Pillay said.The competition will run until the end of November, after which an overall winner will be selected and announced as the SuperSport Let&rsquo;s Play Star of the Year 2017 awards.
