We had extra classes, study camps and afternoon study sessions which were supervised by parents,&rdquo; said Mabaso.Mabaso said the school had in February received an award of excellence from the KZN Department of Education.The school, Mabaso said, had used the March exams to identify pupil weaknesses before developing a turnaround strategy to deal with these.&ldquo;The community was also very happy about the school&rsquo;s performance. The highest pass rate we have ever received in this school was 94%, so this is a great achievement for the entire community,&rdquo; he said.Mabaso said among the problems that the school had to deal with was drug use that had affected some of the pupils.&ldquo;Whatever affects the community also affects us a school because we do not exist in isolation,&rdquo; he said.Motivational speakers were brought in to help pupils overcome the drug problem.Mabaso added that he was determined to maintain the school&rsquo;s 100% matric pass rate. Sadtu KZN secretary Nomarashiya Caluza said Sadtu started the awards after noticing that very little was being done to honour schools that had performed well. &ldquo;Teachers are criticised all the time and people forget the appalling conditions they work under. &ldquo;The awards serve to thank the teachers for the good work they do and also to encourage them to do more,&rdquo; said Caluza.
