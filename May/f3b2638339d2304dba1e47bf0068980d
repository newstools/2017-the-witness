Armed men tied up a Chase Valley man, his caregiver and a domestic worker during a home invasion robbery in broad daylight on Tuesday. The man and caregiver were also hit on the heads with a gun.The homeowner, who refused to be named in fear of being targeted again, told The Witness that she was not at home when her husband, who is recovering from a stroke, his caregiver and their domestic worker were assaulted and robbed at gunpoint in their home in English Road, Chase Valley.She said the two robbers, armed with guns, gained access into their property at around 11.30 am through the gate, which was open because their gardener was working there.She said they tied everyone up with cable ties and then ransacked the house, making off with all the television and air-conditioner remote controls, a laptop, a DVD and her husband&rsquo;s vests.The woman said one of the burglars also assaulted her husband and the caregiver by hitting them on their heads with the butt of his gun.&ldquo;They were all very traumatised. The caregiver even said she was not sure if she still wants to work here,&rdquo; she said.She said the gardener, who managed to escape, called a relative who called the police but by the time they arrived the men had left.She said she was worried that her home may have been targeted because the burglars allegedly kept on asking, &ldquo;Where is the boss?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where does the boss keep the money?&rdquo;.&ldquo;After my husband had a stroke I took over the family business and I think it was quite strange that the robbers were asking for the boss despite my husband, who is the man of the house, being there,&rdquo; she said.This was the third burglary at their home in seven years, she said.She said in 2011 she was at home with her daughter when armed robbers broke in and ransacked their home. In 2014 their home was ransacked by burglars who broke open the safe and stole money inside and a spare key for their car, which was parked in the garage. She said the burglars stole the car, which has never been recovered.The woman said she was planning to upgrade her security.&ldquo;We will install CCTV cameras and also hire a security guard who will patrol our property day and night.&rdquo;Video footage from the neighbour&rsquo;s CCTV camera shows two men walking along the road before the house was robbed, wearing similar clothing to the robbers.Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese confirmed that a case of house robbery was opened and said no one had been arrested yet.
