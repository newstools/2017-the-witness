Mountain Rise policewomen put aside their police gear for baby blankets when they delivered a healthy baby boy, now named Sergeant, to a woman who was unable to make it to hospital.On Tuesday morning a distressed Nkhetheleng Molefe (24) went into labour and called an ambulance to take her to hospital but when the ambulance failed to arrive after an hour, she decided to catch a taxi to Northdale Hospital.The taxi transported her from her home in Cinderella Park and dropped her along Royston Road.Molefe said the taxi driver had told her that he could not take her to hospital as it was not along his route, and left her at the roadside and drove off.&ldquo;I was walking down the road and crying,&rdquo; said Molefe.She said she saw the police station and went inside to ask police to call an ambulance for her.While she waited for the ambulance, Molefe&rsquo;s water broke and the policewomen of Mountain Rise immediately rallied around her to help her through the delivery.Mountain Rise police station canteen staffer Mavis Molefe said she walked into the charge office and saw a woman crying.&ldquo;I asked her what was going on and she said she was in labour, so I ran down the passage and called some of the officers to help.&rdquo;Mountain Rise police spokesperson Captain Gay Ebrahim said the policewomen set down a mattress for the young mother to lie on and as she lay down, her water broke.&ldquo;I told her to push while we made a screen around her with some blankets,&rdquo; said Mavis Molefe.&ldquo;I could see it was hard for her but we kept on telling her to push until I finally saw the baby&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;Nkhetheleng Molefe said it was her first child and she was grateful to the women for helping her to deliver her healthy baby boy. She said she named him Sergeant Tsepiso as he had been born in a police station.She said if it had not been for the help of the policewomen, she feared that Sergeant, who was born weighing three kilograms, might not have survived.Mavis, who shares the Molofe surname with Sergeant&rsquo;s mother, said she had appointed herself the baby&rsquo;s &ldquo;station gogo&rdquo; and hoped Sergeant and Molefe would visit the police station soon.Ebrahim said the proud dad, Khothatso Mofokeng, arrived shortly after the birth and the new family were taken to Northdale Hospital by police in one of the policewomen&rsquo;s private vehicles.&ldquo;I feel so happy and grateful towards the police for going out of their way to help me,&rdquo; a smiling Molefe said.She said she would bring Sergeant to the station again in a few months&rsquo; time so all the policewomen could see him.
