A Bishopstowe pensioner, who received no help from the municipality, has sent his invoice to the city after he personally repaired a burst pipe near his property.Arthur Knox (78) hired labourers, purchased the equipment needed and got down on his haunches to repair the burst pipe last week.He has now billed the Msunduzi municipality R1 762,50 for the repair.Knox said the pipe burst on May 18 and after five days of unanswered calls to the municipality and living without water, Knox said he had to do something.&ldquo;It was the frustration with the municipality and the fact that I had to see all this good water go to waste that pushed me to just do it on my own,&rdquo; Knox said.Known as the &ldquo;Jack of all trades&rdquo; in Bishopstowe, Knox also collects the post from the Willowton Road post office and delivers it to everyone in the area daily.&ldquo;Now I can say I also fix burst pipes,&rdquo; he laughed.With the help of hired labourers, Knox disconnected the main pipe to the water meter and stopped the flow of the water. He purchased the necessary materials and sorted out the burst pipe, which allowed all five affected households to receive water again after five days. &ldquo;I notified the [municipal] call centre to explain the problem and still no reply. I have removed the water meter, which I now have in my possession,&rdquo; Knox said.
