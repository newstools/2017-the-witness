A pair of alleged robbers picked the wrong man to try and rob on Tuesday morning.The showdown between the pair and the armed security guard they tried to attack, left one of the alleged robbers dead.An Mi7 security guard had been waiting for his lift to Newcastle on Tuesday morning on the N3 near the Liberty Midlands Mall when two men approached him.Mi7 national group manager Colin David said the men tried to rob the guard. One of the men allegedly produced a knife when he saw the guard&rsquo;s gun.David said the man with the knife had sliced open the guard&rsquo;s jacket pocket in an attempt to steal his firearm when the guard retaliated and fired a shot, killing one of the men. The other man fled the scene and police later tracked him to Masukwana Street where they arrested him.David said the guard was good at his job and would be offered counselling following the shooting. He said the guard, who may not be named as a case of murder has been opened against him, had previously been stabbed in a similar incident several months ago.He added that the area had become a hotspot for crime and that many people waiting for transport on that stretch of road had been robbed and assaulted in the past few months.Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said a case of robbery was also opened.He said there had been a spike in criminal activity at the Chota Motala and Church Street interchange.
