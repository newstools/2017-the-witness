Top-eight contenders Maritzburg United kept their hopes of finishing in the top half of the Absa Premiership table alive, with a goalless draw against Platinum Stars, but the clash at Harry Gwala Stadium last night was overshadowed by a brawl.The Team of Choice started the match in lively fashion, combining nicely in the visitors&rsquo; half, signalling their intentions minutes into the game with skipper Kurt Lentjies forcing shot-stopper Mbongeni Mzimela into a save.Both teams continued to create chances through the middle of the park, with striker Fileccia Andrea trying his luck from range in the 11th minute, but again Mzimela was alert as he made a decent save to keep the scoreline goalless. At the interval the score remained 0-0.The Absa Premiership Manager of the Month for April Fadlu Davids made an early change in the second half by bringing on Evans Rusike and Mohau Mokate for Fileccia and Bandile Shandu to stabilise their attack.Both teams launched attacks, looking to break the deadlock but it was not to be, as tensions boiled over between hosts United and Dikwena.As a result, Kwanda Mngonyama and Kulegani Madondo were given their marching orders by referee Cedric Muvhali.The incident left both teams with just 10 players on the pitch.Maritzburg remain seventh on the league standings with 36 points from 28 matches, while Cavin Johnson&rsquo;s men also stay put in 11th place with 31 points from 28 games.The Team of Choice went into this encounter having lost 1-0 to leaders Bidvest Wits in their previous league game which was played in Pretoria on the weekend. On a more positive note, United now have an impressive five-match unbeaten home record and look comfortable to qualify for the MTN8 come the end of the season.The Pietermaritzburg side will be in league action next week when they travel to title contenders Mamelodi Sundowns who will be hungry for points after being held to a 2-2 draw by Baroka.Here&rsquo;s how United lined up: Virgil Vries (GK), Bevan Fransman, Denis Weidlich, Kwanda Mngonyama, Fortune Makaringe, Andrea Fileccia, Siphesihle Ndlovu, Bandile Shandu, Lebohang Maboe, Kurt Lentjies, Deolin Mekoa.Substitutes: Bongani Mpandle (GK), Bryce Moon, Mohau Mokate, Evans Rusike, Mlondi Dlamini, Devon Saal, Themba Shabalala.&bull; nondumiso.zakwe@witness.co.zaLAST NIGHT&rsquo;S RESULTS:Mamelodi Sundowns 2-2 Baroka FCFree State Stars 3-1 Bidwest Wits Bloemfontein Celtic 0-0 Orlando Pirates
