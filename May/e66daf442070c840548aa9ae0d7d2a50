Pietermaritzburg's Art in the Park saw swarms of art lovers enter the KwaZulu-Natal National Botanical Gardens to admire the works of national and local artists on Wednesday.With scores of painters, potters, and crafters exhibiting their work down the Plane Tree Avenue among the fallen autumn leaves, visitors came to admire the art in their numbers.By mid-morning, the Botanical Gardens parking lot was almost completely full with many keen to get a first look at this year&rsquo;s art exhibitions.Durban University eco-tourism students Mbali Msomi and Sithabile Mfeka said although they were not especially fond of art, they enjoyed their morning walking down the aisle of art.&ldquo;We are really enjoying the art,&rdquo; said Mfeka. &ldquo;The meaning behind some of the art is lost to us. &ldquo;It would be nice if people could explain it, but all in all, we are having a really lovely time,&rdquo; she said.First time exhibitor Hillcrest resident Amanda Leggat said it was exciting being able to exhibit her work at Art in the Park. She said she has been painting for 10 years and is a nurse at the Hillcrest hospital.Imbali artist Morgan Mahape said he had been drawing and painting since the age of four.Mahape said the first picture he ever remembered drawing was when he was four and his passion for art grew from then on.He said it was his first time at Art in the Park and he had enjoyed seeing the work of other exhibitors and having positive feedback from art lovers.Hilton resident Cristina Richardson said she had been painting for eight years but decided she wanted to exhibit something other than paintings this year.Richardson turned a chair into a work of art, saying the inspiration came from a shop she had seen while on a visit in Abu Dhabi last year.She said she had seen a display of chairs covered in Dolce and Gabbana images and created her chair under the theme Dolce and Gabbana meets Durban Rickshaw.
