Born and raised in Pietermaritzburg, Pam Thompson of Emile&rsquo;s Hair and Beauty Salon has been a hairdresser for 58 years.She trained many of Pietermaritzburg&rsquo;s hairdressers as well as a few international ones.&ldquo;I was born in Pietermaritzburg and attended Russell Girls&rsquo; High School. I started as a hairdresser at 15 years old. &ldquo;I am very arty and I wanted to do something creative but in those days there was not much scope for creative work and hairdressing was the only thing I could really do.&ldquo;I worked for Salon Roy in Longmarket Street (Langalibalele) for 11 years before I started my own business with my husband, who is a trained and qualified tricho-analyst (a hair analyst). I am 73 and I still work and cut hair and I love it. &ldquo;I particularly enjoy training young hairdressers and have trained many of the hairdressers here in Pietermaritzburg as well as hairdressers now living and working overseas.&ldquo;I trained James McMohan (a successful hairstylist and hairdresser who has worked with Heidi Klum and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) as well as Shaun Struwig and Mark Roberts who both have their own salons in London.&ldquo;I came from a very driven family and my dad, who was a well-known runner, really made sure I worked hard at what I did.&ldquo;I have my regular clients, and I love the hair competitions. I love the avant garde , or anything that is out of the ordinary.&ldquo;I have worked as a hairdresser in hair competitions all over the world in places like Hong Kong, and London but Pietermaritzburg is my home.&ldquo;I have come to notice that we have more potential than the rest of the world realises.&ldquo;I am a family person and my family is in Pietermaritzburg and I could not imagine living anywhere else.&ldquo;I will not move from Pietermaritzburg, let alone South Africa and I will definitely not be retiring any time soon.&rdquo;
