Some of the previously disadvantaged paddlers enrolled in the Natal Canoe Club&rsquo;s Change a Life development programme last weekend not only went to the cinema for the first time but also watched a movie about their own lives.The paddlers were given a trip from Table Mountain to Liberty Midlands Mall where they watched the South African movie Beyond the River , in which they are featured in some of the scenes.Libby Edmonds, who organised the outing, said for some of the paddlers it was their first time at the cinema.&ldquo;My husband is a seasoned paddler and we were so moved by this movie that we wanted to share it with as many people as possible,&rdquo; said Edmonds.&ldquo;This is a great movie for all South Africans, whether they paddle or not, and we are delighted by the positive response that we received in our appeal to have the day sponsored.&rdquo;She said donations from members of the Natal Canoe Club, Cine Centre and Duncan Paul of Spur made the day happen. &ldquo;These young paddlers get to see this fantastic uplifting story about how sport can be a life changer for many,&rdquo; said Edmonds, adding the group&rsquo;s movie tickets, popcorn, burger and chips and Coke were all sponsored.Paddling coach for the group, Lucas Mthalane, said they all enjoyed the day and thought the movie was &ldquo;lovely&rdquo;.&ldquo;Some of us were in some of the scenes in the movie so we were very excited when we saw it,&rdquo; he said.
