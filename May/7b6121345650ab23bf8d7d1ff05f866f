The director of the Royal Agricultural Showgrounds, Terry Strachan, has a soft spot for Pietermaritzburg despite spending his school and university years between Pretoria and Johannesburg.&ldquo;I was born in Johannesburg in 1952 and attended St Alban&rsquo;s College in Pretoria.&ldquo;After high school, I went to Wits University where I studied a BComm legal.&ldquo;After graduating, in 1973, I set up a company that manufactured personal protective equipment.&ldquo;In 1988 another Johannesburg company bought the business as they saw it as a good business opportunity. I remained at the company for a further five years and left in 1993.&ldquo;I always had a desire to try my hand at farming so we [Strachan and his wife] bought a small farm in the Mooi River area focusing on growing cabbages, spinach and broccoli.&ldquo;It was a big move and was initially exciting but I realised that although our venture was successful, you have to be born into farming. I felt like a square peg in a round hole.&ldquo;Then, totally by accident, we received an offer for the farm which was considered and accepted.&ldquo;We then moved to Pietermaritzburg as my daughter was schooling at St Anne&rsquo;s.&ldquo;I put out feelers for a position, believing I would probably end up back in Johannesburg where my network was based. But within a short period of moving to the city, I was approached by the Royal Agricultural Society and was offered a job as general manager in 1996.&ldquo;In 2010, the title changed to CEO but my work remained the same.&ldquo;I find the size of Pietermaritzburg suits me immensely. I am not inclined to live in tiny towns nor larger cities as I find them to be lacking in the sense of community.&ldquo;Pietermaritzburg is perfect. I feel it is one of the most beautiful cities in the country as it is the only one surrounded by a horseshoe of escarpment.&ldquo;It is possibly South Africa&rsquo;s most beautifully located city.&ldquo;One of my greatest wishes, however, is that the office bearers representing the city would market Pietermaritzburg more intensely.&rdquo;
