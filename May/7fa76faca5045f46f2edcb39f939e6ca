It's a case of so far so good at this year&rsquo;s Royal Agricultural Show.The showgrounds bustled with activity on Monday with some visitors travelling from Durban to marvel over the array of exhibits, crafts and food markets. By 10 am on Monday morning, the showgrounds were abuzz with people crowding the exhibition halls, looking at all that was on offer and enjoying the mild weather.From furniture to art, food, crafts and much more, showgoers walked around the grounds looking for new and interesting stands.A Kloof couple, Brian and Pam Suckling, were found browsing the many different homemade jams in the craft hall, next to scores of colourful and bright quilts hanging from the walls and stairwells.The couple said it was their first day at this year&rsquo;s show and they had enjoyed the experience &ldquo;immensely&rdquo;.&ldquo;We come to the Royal Show every year and we always enjoy it,&rdquo; said Pam.&ldquo;We love the atmosphere and drove from Kloof this morning specifically to visit the show.&rdquo;Brian said the high point of the show for him were the woodwork crafts as he had enjoyed doing woodwork himself, with some of his work appearing at the Show during previous years.A Pietermaritzburg mother and daughter were also found enjoying the show, bonding over candy at one of the food stalls.Eileen Bloem and Rosalie Akerman said they had had a lovely day at the show, especially as the grounds were a little quieter than they had been over the weekend.&ldquo;It is lovely today. I have had time to see the exhibitions. My favourite is the fudge. I have a sweet tooth,&rdquo; said Bloem with a smile.Akerman said she had brought her children to the show over the weekend and that they had enjoyed every second they had spent at the grounds.&ldquo;The kids loved it and I love anything that my children enjoy,&rdquo; said Akerman. &ldquo;Personally, I enjoy coming to the show to look at the jewellery but otherwise I come for my children.&rdquo;The Police Search and Rescue diving stand attracted attention as divers waved from the windows of a large tank filled with water.Police search and rescue dog Chaz also attracted quite a bit of attention with his fluffy coat, and warm nature.
