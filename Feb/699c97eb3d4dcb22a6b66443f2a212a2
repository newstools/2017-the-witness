A Pietermaritzburg primary school teacher was attacked and threatened with rape and murder by two men during a robbery on Tuesday.The woman, believed to be in her sixties, arrived at her home in Lincoln Meade on Tuesday afternoon to find two men in her house. The men allegedly switched off the home&rsquo;s electricity before she arrived, ensuring that the alarm battery was not working.When the woman entered her home, the assailants grabbed her and dragged her to her bedroom, allegedly forcing her to keep her head down so she would not see their faces.PMB Security head Mary Ann Jeffery said the men tied the woman&rsquo;s hands and feet together with telephone wire before shoving a facecloth into her mouth and covering her mouth with duct tape.Jeffery said the attackers told the woman they were going to rape her and then kill her as they wrapped her inside a duvet cover.She said eventually once the woman could no longer hear anyone in the house, she struggled to get the duct tape off of her mouth and tore through the duvet with her teeth to escape.Jeffery said the house had been ransacked but it appeared that only jewellery and a cellphone were taken. She said the woman, still tied up and half-covered in the duvet, had managed to get out of the house and onto the road and attracted the attention of a woman walking with her child. &ldquo;The passer-by saw our number on the signboard on the woman&rsquo;s gate and called us, saying there was a woman who was desperate and crying for help,&rdquo; said Jeffery.Alexandra Road police and emergency services were immediately called to the scene, however, the woman was more traumatised as a result of the incident than physically hurt.Jeffery said the police and the emergency services had responded quickly and were &ldquo;absolutely fantastic&rdquo; about helping the traumatised woman. She urged all residents to be vigilant and aware of their surroundings at all times, especially when arriving home.Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said no arrests had been made at this stage and police were investigating.The Witness called the victim of the incident yesterday but she declined to talk about her ordeal.
