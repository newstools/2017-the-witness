Aliza&rsquo;s relative fetched her for a visit on February 10 but has not returned the child since. The distraught mother said that she attempted to contact the relative on numerous occasions but was unsuccessful and she was forced to open a missing person&rsquo;s report last week. &ldquo;We have gone to [the relative&rsquo;s] home and no one knows where they took the baby. [A family member] said they last saw [the relative] leaving with baby Aliza on February 13,&rdquo; said Sadique.uMgungundlovu North cluster spokesperson Captain Gay Ebrahim said police are looking for the relative. &ldquo;We just want to question [the relative] at this point,&rdquo; Ebrahim said. The emotional Sadique struggled to talk as The Witness interviewed her at the Mountain Rise police station yesterday. The desperate mother said they have searched for the relative everywhere but his phone has since been switched off. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had sleepless nights and just can&rsquo;t stop looking at her cute smile in the pictures. I have had to endure the pain of not knowing where my only baby is or if she has eaten,&rdquo; said a tearful Sadique. A missing person&rsquo;s inquiry was opened on February 16 and police are urging the community to come forward with information. &ldquo;All I want is to reunite with my daughter. Life is no longer the same anymore. The house has become too big without her jumping around,&rdquo; said Sadique.
