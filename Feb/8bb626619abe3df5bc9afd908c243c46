In the spirit of learning while having fun, a video of a performance by the Pietermaritzburg Girls&rsquo; High School&rsquo;s (GHS) gospel choir group has gone viral.The video of the songbirds was posted on the school&rsquo;s Facebook page on Tuesday last week and has since been viewed more than 50 500 times and has more than 1 100 shares.The choir&rsquo;s young conductor, pupil Zazi Kunene (17), said they had not imagined the video would receive such wonderful feedback.&ldquo;It is absolutely mind blowing. We were just doing what we love and expressing ourselves,&rdquo; she said.Zazi, who is also the chairperson of the gospel choir, said the committee members often watch YouTube videos to get song ideas and inspiration and also encourage other choir members to add ideas.Sibahle Mabaso (17), who started singing in primary school, said she doesn&rsquo;t often get very excited about things, but expressed how &ldquo;extremely happy&rdquo; she and the other choir members were about their video going viral.&ldquo;Once you&rsquo;ve done something for such a long time you start forgetting how good you are and take it for granted. &ldquo;Our aim was to be good but we never thought we&rsquo;d be this good. &ldquo;So the reaction came as a huge surprise to all of us, we couldn&rsquo;t stop jumping with excitement in class,&rdquo; said Sibahle.Secretary of the gospel choir, Zekhethelo Shobela, said she comes from a musical family and wanted to continue the family&rsquo;s legacy. She joined a choir in grade R.&ldquo;I feel like an old soul. I get my inspiration from artists like Lauryn Hill.&ldquo;I am forever singing and always get myself in trouble for singing in the classroom,&rdquo; laughed Zekhethelo. The girls said they rehearse every Monday and perform at school events and at other schools.GHS acting principal Cathy Trodd said they were very happy about the feedback and recognition they were getting on Facebook.&ldquo;We have so much musical talent at our school and we are always proud to showcase that talent at various functions both at school and in the wider community,&rdquo; said Trodd.GHS Gospel Choir singing 'Mary did you know?'
