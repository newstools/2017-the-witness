Well known for their hiking and music interests, Prestbury couple Paul and Lorraine Welch have been together for 50 years and according to Paul, it was &ldquo;love at first sight&rdquo;.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m originally from England. The first thing I did when I came to Pietermaritzburg was to join the Ramblers hiking club. I met Lorraine during a hike with the club and she was well known by everyone there. I met her again at an event that she sang in, but from that first time I knew she was the one,&rdquo; said Paul. For Lorraine, it was that English decorum that drew her to Paul.&ldquo;I had been living in London for four years and I met Paul the week after I came back. We naturally gravitated towards each other as we could relate to a lot of our English experiences. I was supposed to go back to England, but ended up staying after meeting Paul,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Paul was a professional electrical engineer and I worked at Umgeni Water for many years. It was our shared love for similar interests that has sustained our love for each other, long after retiring from our busy careers,&rdquo; said Lorraine. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve hiked up Mount Kenya and we&rsquo;ve done a lot of trails all over the world,&rdquo; said Paul.The couple said they also love music and are &ldquo;crazy about animals&rdquo;. The parents of two sons and a daughter, the couple said their children were brought up with a strict hand. &ldquo;My grandson from Ballito often says, &lsquo;You better watch this granny, she&rsquo;s very strict.&rsquo; With me, it&rsquo;s either the one way or the other, nothing in between,&rdquo; said Lorraine. &ldquo;We were also brought up in strict households. I was brought up during wartime in England, which was probably as strict as it gets,&rdquo; said Paul.&ldquo;For any successful marriage you have to be willing to forgive. We all make mistakes. &ldquo;No one is perfect. If you don&rsquo;t forgive you&rsquo;ll harbour feelings that can ruin you. Don&rsquo;t go to bed angry with each other. Communication is key,&rdquo; said Lorraine.The Welches have been subscribers to The Witness for about 45 years. &ldquo;When I was in Manchester I used to read the Manchester Guardian , a newspaper that was not just news oriented, but made you think as well. I found The Witness to be quite similar,&rdquo; said Paul.&ldquo;Our Witness subscription came back last Saturday which was coincidently our 50th anniversary. When I saw it, I was very excited, it actually felt like another anniversary present,&rdquo; said Lorraine.
