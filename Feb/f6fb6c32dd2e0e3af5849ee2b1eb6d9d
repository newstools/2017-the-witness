The premier is worried by the proliferation of firearms in the province,&rdquo; said Sibiya.&ldquo;We are a traumatised society which was ravaged by political violence &hellip; the premier is calling on leaders of society and the community at large to rid the province of illegal firearms,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The premier will be delivering his state of the province address on Wednesday.&ldquo;He is expected to present a plan on social cohesion, moral regeneration and the reconstruction of the soul,&rdquo; said Sibiya.Friday's shooting followed the brutal murder of a Pietermaritzburg policewoman allegedly at the hands of her boyfriend last December.Sergeant Thabisile Penelope Zondi (41), who was stationed at Plessislaer police station, was beaten to death with a pickaxe handle.It was alleged at the time that the attacker often argued with Zondi and was known to be abusive towards her.In another incident in April last year, a local policeman was charged with shooting dead his wife, advanced midwife at Edendale Hospital Thabisile Doyisa (46).Doyisa had just arrived home from her shift when she was shot in her head at point-blank range with an R5 rifle.Commission of Gender Equality spokesperson Javu Baloyi said the commission highly condemned such attacks. He called on people in abusive relationships to speak up immediately and go to the police or any other authority when the first threat is issued by a partner. &ldquo;We also call upon the authorities to take harsher measures by sentencing abusive partners to longer jail sentences. It is of no use if they are arrested and released immediately to attack again,&rdquo; Baloyi said.
