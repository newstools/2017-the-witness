Some Cleland residents have complained about mysterious solid stop lines that have recently been painted on the intersection of Jasmine Road and Petrea Avenue.The residents say the lines have caused chaos with motorists suddenly braking at the intersection.They said Jasmine Road has always been a main road without any stop lines in the middle. Petrea Avenue that runs across Jasmine had always been a yield area.Some of the residents are convinced that these new road lines were painted by someone who wanted to make the intersection a four-way stop. &ldquo;The main problem is that some drivers stop at these new lines while other drivers speed past as they are used to the road not having any stop lines in the middle,&rdquo; said a resident who has been living in Cleland for over 30 years. There are concerns that the lines could lead to car accidents in the area.Jeremy Apelgren, who has been living in Cleland for more than nine years, said the intersection has never been a four- way stop. &ldquo;I was surprised when these lines miraculously appeared,&rdquo; Apelgren said. Another Cleland resident, Bheki Sithole who has lived in the area for 23 years, also confirmed that these road signs are new. &ldquo;For all the years I have lived here, there were no stop lines at the intersection of Jasmine Road and Petrea Avenue,&rdquo; Sithole said. He also added that he fears that these lines will confuse drivers and the confusion will lead to a significant increase in accidents.Msunduzi municipality spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said no one is allowed to paint any signs on the road as it is illegal. &ldquo;The municipality urges the residents to report such perpetrators so that the roads and signage department can investigate the matter and take corrective action,&rdquo; Mafumbatha said.
