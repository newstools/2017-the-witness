Imbali&rsquo;s 033 Lifestyle has become the go-to night club in Pietermaritzburg and co-owner Bonga Ndaba, who won the PCB Entrepreneur of the Year Award, says 033 is all about putting Pietermaritzburg on the map.&ldquo;The idea to purchase the place where 033 is situated came in 2010 when my business partner, Malusi Ntshangase, found out that the previous tenants who were running a butchery and car wash business wanted to leave,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We approached them and they put us in contact with the property owners and the rest as they say is history.&ldquo;033 Lifestyle was launched on the same day as the 2010 Soccer World Cup, which was hosted for the first time ever in South Africa that year.&rdquo;Coming from different industries, my partner an engineer and me from the corporate world, certainly branched into business with a bang.&ldquo;For me it was an opportunity to put my MBA expertise into practice as I had just recently graduated.&ldquo;And through a whole lot of blood, sweat and tears we managed to turn the place around from a turnover of about R80 000 a month to, this past December, a turnover of about R1,9 million.&ldquo;It has been an absolute roller coaster. We faced many challenges. Being based in the township, we&rsquo;ve had to make sure our security standards were up to par to be able to reach the desired target market.&ldquo;033 is an all-inclusive township lifestyle centre featuring a car wash, barber shop, bottle store, butchery, pub and a restaurant serving shisa&shy;nyama and traditional cuisine.&ldquo;We found that although Pietermaritzburg is referred to as the City of Choice, most tourists often chose Durban when visiting KZN. We wanted to change that around and place Pietermaritzburg on the global map as the number one go-to area in KZN.&ldquo;And as a brand I would say we&rsquo;ve managed to break into that international scene, especially in terms of deep house music.&ldquo;We specifically play only deep house music because further than the genre being our personal favourite, we wanted to grab a particular crowd into 033, giving it a distinctive edge from other similar venues.&ldquo;We recently released an 033 Life&shy;style deep house compilation album featuring outstanding deep house DJs, including some locals.&ldquo;We give back to the Pitermaritzburg community through various ventures.&ldquo;This includes close works with the Themba Njilo Foundation, Sekunjalo Project and contributing to the local clinic and a primary school.&ldquo;Employing over 50 locals on weekends, 033 Lifestyle is by Pietermaritzburg people for Pietermaritzburg people. My function is only that of a conductor to an orchestra.&ldquo;Winning the award meant a lot because we don&rsquo;t really make a lot of profit out of 033, we only do it for the upliftment of the Pietermaritzburg community. It was good to know that all our hard work is getting recognised,&rdquo; he concluded.
