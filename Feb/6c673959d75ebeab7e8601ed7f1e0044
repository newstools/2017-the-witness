Maritzburg United head coach Roger de Sa says his entire team knows what is at stake ahead of this evening&rsquo;s Absa Premiership encounter against an on-form Supersport United, as he resumes the quest for his first league win at the helm.Winless in his first two league outings since taking over the reins and having dropped out of the top eight as The Team of Choice now lie ninth on the log standings. De Sa is fully aware of the implication should results not go their way in Pretoria.The 53-year-old who is yet to record a win at the Pietermaritzburg-based club admitted to The Witness he is expecting a tough encounter against Amatsantsatsa.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a good 10 days. Obviously we&rsquo;ve had time to work on a few things and hopefully going into this game we&rsquo;ll rectify all the notable mistakes we made in our previous games. We&rsquo;re hoping for a win and a morale-booster. It&rsquo;s not going to be easy but I&rsquo;ve worked with my boys and I know how much they want this win. Supersport have an unbeaten record to maintain, but we also know what&rsquo;s at stake here,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Maritzburg United are coming into this game at the back of a 2-1 defeat to high-flying Kaizer Chiefs almost two weeks ago, while The Swanky Boys dropped points against a stubborn Free State Stars on Wednesday.Stuart Baxter&rsquo;s men have shown that they really mean business this season, and their position on the log is evident, as they sit fourth, four points adrift of leaders Amakhosi with 29 points.The Pretoria-based club have the wind in their sails, currently enjoying a 15-match unbeaten run, including a 6-1 demolition of struggling Orlando Pirates, a 1-0 win at Harry Gwala Stadium in September last year and most recently a 5-2 triumph against Golden Arrows.&nbsp;Nonetheless, the former Bafana Bafana goalkeeper will be focusing on winning the game rather than on the history of both clubs.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously going to be a difficult game for us. Our opponents have gone a rather long unbeaten run that they want to maintain. But, we just need to keep focus and keep going and hopefully it works out they way we want it to.&nbsp;&ldquo;We have a good record on the record and hopefully we can build on that again. As I&rsquo;ve said before, I don&rsquo;t want to change too much. We just need to change our attitude towards games and start winning those games,&rsquo;&rsquo; he added.As the PMB outfit look to improve on a run of three consecutive draws and a defeat in their last four league games, the new mentor has opted not to rest too many of his established players.He is likely to name a strong line-up that will be boosted by the returns of skipper Kurt Lentjies, who has missed the last two games through suspension, attacker Devon Saal and defender Blessing Moyo, who are also available for selection.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a relief that Kurt [Lentjies], Devon [Saal] and Blessing [Moyo] are all coming back. It helps a lot because it&rsquo;s important that we win this game.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unfortunately Andrea Fileccia is still not ready yet but we&rsquo;ll continue watching him in training. But we look forward to the opportunity to be with those guys,&rdquo; De Sa concluded.Also not yet fit is defender Brian Onyango.&nbsp;United are ninth on the table behind Chippa United on goal-difference and 13 points adrift of leaders the Phefeni boys going into tonight&rsquo;s encounter. Kickoff at Lucas Moripe Stadium is scheduled for 7.30 pm.
