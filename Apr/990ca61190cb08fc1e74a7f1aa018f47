Witness&nbsp; readers took to Facebook to guess the year of a picture taken in Church Street and published in the paper recently.Many readers suggested that the picture had been taken in the 1950s or early 1960s.Chris Black said: &ldquo;I think the OK Bazaars had moved to their new site further up the road by the 60s, so this picture is more likely to be sometime in the 50s.&rdquo;Gael Dewar said: &ldquo;Also think 50s. Skirt lengths started getting shorter in about 1966. But a wonderful reminder of a more elegant age in the shop signage &mdash; happy memories.&rdquo;Safwaan Abdool commented about how clean the city was back then.&ldquo;1960s and the streets look so clean; 57 years later Church Street looks worse than a dump, can&rsquo;t help but wonder what will the condition of this town be in the next couple of years!!!&rdquo; said Abdool.&ldquo;Remember the white line down the middle of Church Street pavement and people walked on the correct side! How orderly things were,&rdquo; said Colin-Debs Lucke.Bruce Braithwaite said he walked on the very same street every Monday and had witnessed how &ldquo;filthy&rdquo; the street is now.&ldquo;It sad to see the degradation of our once pristine city centre,&rdquo; said Braithwaite.Marcel Darrin Peters said &ldquo;Such a beautiful site eish now I wouldn&rsquo;t even walk there.&rdquo;Beverley Bradbury said &ldquo;I would also say the 1960s and I remember Cuthberts!&rdquo;Zai Joseph said &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t believe it ever looked like that ... wow!&rdquo;Anthony Naidoo said the picture reminded him of the apartheid era and suggested that the picture be shredded but Bruce Braithwaite said history cannot be erased no matter how much we get rid of its evidence.&ldquo;Shredding it does not erase it. Apartheid was abhorrent, but as I look around not much has changed for the poorest of the poor.Donato Donatello di Niccolo said &ldquo;You cannot sanitise history Naidoo.&rdquo;Colin-Debs Lucke said it was definitely the late 1950s.
