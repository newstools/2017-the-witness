Many residents and businesses in and around Pietermaritzburg have been battling to stay connected via their Telkom ADSL lines.Numerous irate Telkom customers said they have tried multiple avenues to resolve their Telkom problems, but have been sent back and forth by Tel&shy;kom consultants. Telkom came under heavy criticism as people sent their complaints to The Witness about the unstable Telkom Internet connection problems which for some, date back three months.A branch manager at Macdonald Steel on Willowton Road, Hylton Deale, said he has been experiencing connectivity problems in Willowton and in Prestbury. &ldquo;It is affecting my business and I am fed up with the whole situation.&ldquo;Telkom needs to advise what the problem is and resolve it,&rdquo; said Deale.Henry Spencer from Prestbury said he and his neighbours have been &ldquo;plagued&rdquo; by Telkom ADSL problems.&ldquo;One cannot send or receive e-mails.&ldquo;I went to Anvision, a computer and network shop, to ascertain whether my computer had a problem, and in the 10 minutes that I was there at least three other people came in with the same complaint. &ldquo;This is not an individual problem it is an area-wide problem!&rdquo; he said.Spencer said he called Telkom and found that the &ldquo;consultant didn&rsquo;t have a clue&rdquo; on how to assist him. &ldquo;I know that we live in the wilds of Africa, but is Telkom so inept that we will have to revert to messages on cleft sticks, or carrier pigeons?&rdquo; said Spencer.Shanna Moreno from Pelham said she has been experiencing problems with her Internet connection for the past two weeks.&ldquo;Telkom hasn&rsquo;t given any answers as to what the problem is,&rdquo; said Moreno.Debbie Allingham from Howick said she is &ldquo;completely at a loss as what to do&rdquo; as her Internet has been going down every day.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to run an online business from home so you can imagine the frustration,&rdquo; she said.Lari Govender from Howick Travel said they have been having intermittent connectivity over the last two weeks, which has had a significant effect on their Internet-driven business.&ldquo;The Telkom call centre staff offer no assistance and have limited technical knowledge. &ldquo;We have opened numerous cases via the call centre, which are mysteriously closed with no end in sight,&rdquo;Liesel Landsberg said she was hopeful that Telkom would be honest with their customers and tell them that there have been problems with their Internet and hopefully credits will be given where they should.PK Naidoo said the most &ldquo;frustrating aspect&rdquo; was that Telkom does not keep their customers informed if there is a general problem.&ldquo;So one continues to be under the impression that your devices may be faulty and the problem is unique to yourself. I am seriously thinking of jumping ship,&rdquo; said Naidoo.Inge von Luttichou said she has two matriculants in her house who depend on the Internet to do research and university applications.&ldquo;I am also studying online and have to submit weekly. My course work is suffering.&ldquo;This cannot continue like this. We need help please,&rdquo; said Luttichou.Telkom spokesperson Gugulethu Maqetuka said he was still waiting for feedback from the regional technicians who were still conducting investigations on Tuesday afternoon. Maqetuka promised to report back to The Witness&nbsp;on Wednesday.&ldquo;We want to conduct proper investigations so that we can come up with solid solutions to help our customers,&rdquo; he said.
