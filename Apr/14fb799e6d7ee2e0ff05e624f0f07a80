With the Easter weekend starting on Friday, it&rsquo;s go-time as far as Easter goodies are concerned.When it comes to Easter holidays, most people make an effort to fill their basket with Easter eggs to share and indulge in.Local supermarkets all shared the same sentiments about their Easter egg sales hitting the rooftops this year.Mayor&rsquo;s Walk Spar supermarket spokesperson Devashni Moodley said most of the stores have already run out of Easter candy.&ldquo;Most of our stores were already out of Easter treats last week.&ldquo;We tried buying from other supermarkets but they were also running out and some were quite expensive,&rdquo; she said.Moodley said some of their shoppers were buying the Easter candy in bulk.&ldquo;One man bought 210 boxes of Easter eggs and another recently bought 36 boxes.&ldquo;The candy is certainly moving a lot faster than in previous years and I think it has a lot to do with our promotional prices,&rdquo; said Moodley.Jay Soobramoney from Makro said they also have seen better Easter candy sales compared to previous years.&ldquo;We went all out with our stock and we still have quite a variety of Easter bunnies, candy and mushmallows on our shelves,&rdquo; he said.Brookside Mall Checkers supermarket&rsquo;s Hassan Shaik said their shelves were almost empty as people were buying their Easter candy at a faster pace than they had anticipated.&ldquo;We initially had a lot of stock but it&rsquo;s is being wiped out faster than we thought it would,&rdquo; said Shaik.The store manager at Game in the city centre, King Niadoo, said this year they decided to decrease their Easter egg stock considering the current state of the economy.&ldquo;We did not stock as much Easter assortments as we previously stocked because we considered that many people don&rsquo;t spend as much as they used to when it comes to Easter goodies,&rdquo; said Niadoo.&ldquo;However, we are experiencing good sales as we are located in the city centre.&rdquo;
