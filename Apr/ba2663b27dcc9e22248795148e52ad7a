Lily, Daisy, Buttercup, Violet and Rose, five of the 19 donkeys rescued from being skinned alive at the Lesotho border earlier this year, are settled in at a farm in Bethlehem in the Free State.The five adopted donkeys are awaiting the arrival of the rest of the herd, which are expected at the farm soon.Farm owner Dr Astrid Jankielsohn adopted the donkeys in February and said the five had already settled in nicely.&ldquo;They are very happy and so sweet,&rdquo; said Jankielsohn.&ldquo;They are a bit skittish but I go down to talk to them every day.&rdquo;She said the donkeys were &ldquo;very curious&rdquo; and all approached her, trying to smell her without getting too close, whenever she went to talk to them.&ldquo;I have been doing this [adopting animals] for a couple of years now. It is not a formal animal sanctuary but I take animals in and I give them all names.&rdquo;Jankielsohn said she had a few horses, ponies, pigs and three Spanish donkeys that had been on her farm for a few years, called Merlin, Gandalf and Jack.&ldquo;I have the power and the capacity to help and that is why I do it,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I am particularly fond of donkeys. They are amazing, very sweet and intelligent.&rdquo;She said she had decided to adopt the donkeys &mdash; which would have died in a field near Sani Pass after being skinned alive if they had been caught &mdash; after she received a newsletter from the National Council of SPCAs. &ldquo;Animals have no choice. They are just placed in these situations and it is our responsibility to help where we can.&ldquo;I want to give these donkeys what they deserve and I feel that adopting an animal can make such a huge difference even if it seems like a small thing to you.&rdquo;Jankielsohn thanked the NSPCA for all their hard work and said she had &ldquo;huge respect&rdquo; for the organisation.
