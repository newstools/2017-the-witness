The sixth child of a Palestinian mother and fathered by a colonel of the Persian Army, Amal Ma&rsquo;ani-Hessari now owns a successful Pietermaritzburg business and is loved by many in the city.&ldquo;I was born in a small town in the northeast of Iran before moving to the Iranian capital, Tehran.&ldquo;We moved to the UK when I was 14 because two of my brothers were already there.&ldquo;We moved just before the start of the Iranian revolution and in less than a year in the UK, the revolution began.&ldquo;My father was a colonel and was relying on his pension, but when the revolution happened, everything stopped and we became refugees.&ldquo;We could not go back to Iran because anyone above the rank of captain was to be executed. &ldquo;When we moved to the UK, I could not speak a word of English, but I had a wonderful teacher who used free periods to teach me.&ldquo;I schooled in Cornwall and went to design school when I was 17.&ldquo;I met my wife, Sharon, while at college. We were married at 23 and moved to Ireland.&ldquo;All four of my children were born in Northern Ireland.&ldquo;In 1992, I came to South Africa on holiday and fell in love with the country. It was the first time somewhere felt like home.&ldquo;We moved to South Africa in 2003 and, after looking for a province to live in, settled on Pietermaritzburg because of the quality education and because it felt like home.&ldquo;Living in Pietermaritzburg was the first time I felt like I was not a foreigner.&ldquo;People say it is the &lsquo;sleepy hollow&rsquo; but I love the gentleness of life here.&ldquo;I set up my own graphic design company, One Circle, and have clients locally and abroad.&ldquo;I was one of the finalists working with the South African Parliament on the proposed emblem that was launched in March 2007.&ldquo;Pietermaritzburg is a good place. I like the speed of life and I am glad our family chose this city to settle in,&rdquo; Ma&rsquo;ani-Hessari concluded.
