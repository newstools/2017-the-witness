Pietermaritzburg - Police are considering opening a mobile police station in Ndaleni, Richmond, where deputy mayor Thandazile Phoswa was shot dead.Community Safety and Liaison MEC Mxolisi Kaunda said that police are conducting a feasibility study, as the area is a hotbed of killings.Kaunda visited the Phoswa family on Tuesday alongside Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube, and Finance MEC Belinda Scott.&ldquo;At the moment we have sent one police van to service the area. We are hoping that the police are going to do their best,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We do not want this to bring back violence that was here in Richmond.&ldquo;Of course this one is an isolated incident. It is not like the others where the suspects just disappear after the shooting. Here there were two people in the house when it happened.&rdquo;Kaunda said the killing had come as a shock to him.&ldquo;I had been here on Sunday to deliberate on issues that were raised by community members. We were convinced that our contribution was going to go a long way, but on Monday we received the sad news,&rdquo; he said.Dube-Ncube said she had expected a lot from Phoswa.&ldquo;We come here with sad hearts because we are still reeling at the loss of the municipal manager. We were hoping that the municipality will dust themselves and continue delivering services without any distractions.&ldquo;We have recently formed our councils after the recent local government elections. Communities are still expecting a lot from councils,&rdquo; she said.Dube-Ncube said the continued killings have a negative impact on service delivery in local government.&ldquo;We are glad that there is a team that is looking at violence in the area.&rdquo;She said everything was in place for Richmond officials to &ldquo;take the chapter started by Phoswa forward&rdquo;.The MEC pleaded with community members to allow police to do their work and not &ldquo;cast aspersions&rdquo;.Phoswa was shot on Monday morning while at her home.Police have arrested a bodyguard from uMshwathi Municipality for the murder.
