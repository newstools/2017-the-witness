A Witness&nbsp;employee received top honours at Tuesday&rsquo;s University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) graduation ceremony where she graduated cum laude.Nompumelelo Dlamuka, a sub-editor at The Witness , did a semiotic analysis of images of the #FeesMustFall protest on Instagram during October 2015 for her research project for her Bachelor of Arts Honours degree thesis.Dlamuka analysed the images to determine how racial groups were represented during the protest. She found that although Instagram is about sharing photos instantaneously, which means these images are not usually as carefully framed as professional media photographs, the images reflected the attitude of the country&rsquo;s race groups towards protests.&ldquo;Engaging with samples on Instagram showed that the protest was not inclusive of all races because some were underrepresented throughout the sample, contrary to what was portrayed in mainstream media.&ldquo;This shows that mainstream media does not necessarily always reflect the full picture as images are framed in a certain way,&rdquo; she said.Dlamuka encouraged the youth to &ldquo;take the leap and study further&rdquo;.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one decision with no room for regret. It is a remarkable opportunity to gain practical experience that can open up so many doors for you. &ldquo;There is such a great sense of fulfil&shy;ment in knowing you have produced a piece of quality research with a meaningful finding. Follow your dreams &mdash; then take it a step further,&rdquo; she said.Dlamuka expressed her gratitude to her mother, saying she had been immensely supportive throughout her life. &ldquo;She did everything she could to help me get through each day, constantly encouraging and supporting me, always a beacon of light and hope when times were tough. She would call every day to make sure I was getting my work done and made sure that, even though she was 100 km away, I got to all my classes on time! I am glad that I could make her proud by graduating cum laude,&rdquo; said Dlamuka.Dlamuka said she plans to begin her part time masters degree in media studies before 2020.&nbsp;
