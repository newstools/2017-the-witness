Meet Fiona Bulman, the Pietermaritzburg anti-Zuma activist behind the city&rsquo;s daily &ldquo;eleventh hour&rdquo; silent protest.Bulman&rsquo;s placard demonstration &mdash; which starts at 11 am daily and goes on for 30 minutes opposite the City Hall &mdash; is now starting to gain traction with other supporters joining in.The silent demonstration comes amid renewed calls and mass action protests calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down.Bulman said when she started earlier this month, she was alone. &ldquo;Ours is to defend the Constitution. We do not want to affiliate ourselves with opposition parties who have turned this into electioneering,&rdquo; she said.Bulman said they would be putting the protest on hold until the application brought by the United Democratic Movement to impose a secret ballot vote on a motion of no confidence in Zuma is heard by the Constitutional Court.&ldquo;We will continue from then, even on the day that the debate is held in Parliament, we will be here. &ldquo;For it is all about saying that we support those MPs that still have a conscience. I know there are MPs who still have consciences,&rdquo; she said.The Black Sash&rsquo;s Mary Kleinenberg said the next leg of the silent protest might be done under the banner of her organisation.&ldquo;We the Black Sash, did this in the 80s. It is a disgrace that we have to do it democratic government,&rdquo; she said.
