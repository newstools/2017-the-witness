THE SRC leadership of strike-hit Msunduzi Tvet are working around the clock to resolve issues between management and students before the college re-opens on April 18. On Wednesday student representatives of four uMgugundlovu campuses met with the provincial leadership of the SA Congress of Students (Sasco) in Pietermaritzburg, to deliberate on the crisis faced by students.It emerged that as the result of the strike, which was triggered by non-payment of student allowances by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme last year, the trimester exams were not written.There were also concerns around the reimbursement of the students&rsquo; allowance money for their 2017 academic year, as according to the college policy, students are required to have a minimum of 80% attendance to qualify for the payout of their allowance.Msunduzi Tvet SRC president Ningi Luthuli said students had lost many days due to the strike.Some students were penalised with severe deductions from their allowances.She said another concern is that students from four other campuses under uMgungundlovu Tvet received their full allowances, without any deductions, even though they were on strike for longer.&ldquo;My question is where did the deducted money go? NSFAS pays the college based on the amount claimed by students, but when their portion of it doesn&rsquo;t go to the students, where is it going?&rdquo; she asked. During the meeting, she cited the shortage of lecturers, textbooks, unqualified lecturers, corruption, poor management and delayed results, as some of the factors causing paralysis at the college.&ldquo;When students return to school on the 18th they will be expecting us to give them something different from what we told them when the college closed.&ldquo;However, we will also hear from them whether they are happy with whatever outcome we will give them, and whether they will go back to class or opt to continue striking,&rdquo; Luthuli said.
