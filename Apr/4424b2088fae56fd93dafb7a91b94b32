Residents who have frequented the Msunduzi dump recently and noticed the &ldquo;terrible&rdquo; state that it was in, would be glad to know it is now spotless. The Witness visited the New England Road dump site last week after receiving numerous complaints that the dump was overflowing to a point that there was no parking for patrons. A local resident, Frans Wiese, said in the past 17 years he had never seen the dump in such a bad state as it was recently. Hayfields resident Fred Sabbagha said the dump had not been cleared out for months. &ldquo;I have been using the place for the last 25 years and it is truly mind-boggling because I have never seen such a mess in my life,&rdquo; said Sabbagha. Sabbagha said although it was a dump, it used to be organised, neat and easily accessible to residents. He added that the place was &ldquo;almost unbearable&rdquo; and spoke of a recent fire at the site that kept firefighters working for more than 24 hours to extinguish the blaze.&ldquo;If they [the municipality] are not careful, another fire will burn the place to the ground,&rdquo; he said. The Witness visited the site last Tuesday and found Msunduzi municipal workers hard at work clearing the overflowing rubbish. One municipal worker, Thenjiwe Ndunje, said she was happy to see The Witness journalist and photographer at the site to capture their hard work.&ldquo;You can see now it is cleared and there is no smell,&rdquo; she said. Msunduzi Mayor Themba Njilo recently embarked on a clean-up campaign to clear rubbish near the Jika Joe informal settlement and also tackle the issue of vagrants in the city centre. &ldquo;We must love our city and keep our city clean. &ldquo;We at the municipality will try our level best to make sure Msunduzi is clean and welcoming, but we need the residents to support and assist us. Together this city will be clean,&rdquo; said Njilo.
