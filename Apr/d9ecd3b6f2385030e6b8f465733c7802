The Pietermaritzburg squash community this week welcomed the official opening of the city&rsquo;s first doubles squash court.The doubles squash court forms part of the Collegians Squash complex and adds significant value to the sport within the region, according to Midlands Squash Union (MSU) governor Mike Short.&ldquo;The court follows other investments in recent years at the complex, including an office for the MSU and a 200-seat spectator gallery,&rdquo; he said.Short said while the office and gallery were funded by the MSU, Collegians Squash Club and a National Lotteries Grant, the doubles court was partially sponsored by a local businessman, who is himself an avid former squash player.While the doubles squash court is the same length of a singles court, it is 1,2 metres wider with a full glass back wall, so as to accommodate four players on the court.Likening the impact of doubles squash to that of T20 on Test cricket, Short said it extends the life of a player who in their senior years may find the singles game too demanding.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a game definitely less strenuous and perhaps more social, reason enough for it to grow in popularity,&rdquo; he said.Citing the masters doubles squash interprovincial, now in its 14th year, Short said more than 500 players across the country contest it annually.Doubles squash is also played at a top competitive level, he said.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very excited about the doubles court and believe it will undoubtedly promote squash in the city and indeed in the KZN Midlands. Squash is very active in Pietermaritzburg with close on 600 players playing winter league squash each week and there are several other tournaments that are played within the city, like the Dave Short Inter Provincial tournament in June, which attracts 250 players each year and will be celebrating its 30th anniversary this year,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
