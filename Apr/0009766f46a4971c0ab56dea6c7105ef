A local child carer was left with cuts and bruises after she was ambushed by two men while walking to her workplace in Orient Heights on Tuesday.The incident was followed by another woman being attacked by a knife-wielding man further up the road.Both attacks have further highlighted a continuing trend by opportunistic criminals who are targeting pedestrians walking to and from work in the mornings and late afternoons.But police are not allowing for a crime upsurge in the northern suburbs, with increased patrols proving an effective deterrent in most areas.Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Captain Gay Ebrahim said their office, through the media, has previously warned motorists and pedestrians of crime hot spots in and around the northern suburbs.Ebrahim said the N3 off-ramps at Chota Motala Road, Chota Motala Road at the Mountain Rise crematorium and the bridge on Otto&rsquo;s Bluff Road were all areas of concern for police.However, increased police visibility in those areas have brought robberies, muggings and hijackings to a halt.Ebrahim said now that cases have been reported in the vicinity of Bhambatha Road near Copesville &mdash; where both attacks happened on Tuesday &mdash; extra resources would be diverted there.&ldquo;There is no increase of robberies in the northern suburbs when it comes to pedestrians but we are aware of the problem. &ldquo;The Bhambatha Road area is a contentious one and we have had no incidents there recently. &ldquo;Now that this has been brought to our attention, we will be sure to act,&rdquo; Ebrahim said. Speaking to The Witness&nbsp;on Tues day, the carer&rsquo;s employer, who wished to have both their names excluded from print, said the attack happened early yesterday morning.&ldquo;She was dropped off by a taxi on Bhambatha Road and was walking on a pathway to our house in Capricorn Crescent when she was approached by a man with a gun. Another approached her from the opposite direction with a knife,&rdquo; the employer said.&ldquo;They ransacked her handbag and stole her cash and cellphone. The man with the knife then began punching and kicking her.&rdquo;The employer took the woman to his doctor when she arrived to work with bruises on her face.The second incident happened further up Bhambatha Road near the Ezinkethini informal settlement. It is believed a woman was attacked and robbed at knife point. It is unclear whether this case was reported to the police.
