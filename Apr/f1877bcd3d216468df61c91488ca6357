KZN MECs used the launch of the Westgate Grange Social Housing Site to voice their support for President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s recent cabinet reshuffle.Zuma opened the 1 000-unit social housing project on Saturday in Pietermaritzburg after a week of political drama that ended with the axing of several cabinet ministers and deputy ministers.The embattled president received a standing ovation from the crowd mostly clad in ANC regalia, who sang and chanted slogans that support Zuma.Acting premier and KZN ANC chairperson Sihle Zikalala told those who had gathered at Imbali township that the provincial party supported the changes.&ldquo;I have been hearing people making comments about the recent cabinet reshuffle. What I know is that leadership is like a relay. When you lead there will be a time when you will have to hand over the baton to someone else,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t speak the language of liberation and be supported by oppressors. But if you speak their language, they&rsquo;ll support you,&rdquo; he said.Transport&sbquo; Community Safety and Liaison MEC Mxolisi Kaunda, who is also a member of the ANC provincial executive committee, said they supported Zuma&rsquo;s changes as long as they were going to help people get land and economic transformation.Zuma chose not to speak about the reshuffle, focusing on the housing scheme, which is a R400 million rental project of 1 000 two-bedroomed units, with an open plan kitchen and lounge, and which will be available for rental to people earning between R1 500 and R7 500 a month. The Department of Human Settlements said it is the biggest social housing project in the country.Zuma urged the beneficiaries not to sell their houses. &ldquo;We have noticed a disturbing trend where government housing beneficiaries sell their houses and become indigent again.&rdquo;He said the ANC government had provided 4,5 million families with either houses or subsidies since 1994, and was now also aiming at providing subsidised rental housing to those who earned too much for an RDP house or subsidy, but too little to secure a bond from a commercial bank.
