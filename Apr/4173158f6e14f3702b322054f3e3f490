Municipal plumbers had their hands full on Monday after several copper water meters were stolen in the city, causing hundreds of gallons of water to stream into the streets.Residents on Greyling Street, between West Street and Pine Street, said the theft of water meters is new in their area, although they had heard of it happening in other parts of the city. Two water meters on Greyling Street, situated within 50 metres of each other, were stolen on Sunday night. Municipal plumbers said the theft of the meters is a problem in the city and surrounding areas. The city is replacing copper meters with plastic meters, in order to curb the problem.&ldquo;There are other cases of stolen meters that we are still going to attend to, from here,&rdquo; one said. It is believed that the thieves sell the copper meters to a local scrap yard.Police spokesperson Mthokosize Ngobese issued a stern warning to scrap yard owners who buy the stolen copper meters. He said the police are aware of the problem and are currently working towards ending it.&ldquo;We had a massive breakthrough of a copper bust in Richmond recently, and we will jointly be working with the municipality to deal with this problem in the city,&rdquo; he said.
