I was interested to read that our friend John Deane identified himself in the photo. Like John, I too have lived my whole life in Maritzburg. &nbsp;I wonder if he remembers that we used to be able to buy an ice cream parfait at the OK Bazaars served with chocolate sauce and topped with Horlicks&hellip;.all for 6 pence!&nbsp; Opposite was Irelands where your cash payment was slotted into a metal container and whizzed upstairs on wires where somebody took what was owed and whizzed your change back down to the counter. There are so many stories to be told about those early days in Maritzburg but what I miss most is those wonderfully dramatic thunderstorms which gathered at about two in the afternoons, burst forth with heavy rain and clashing symbols, followed by sunshine and a rainbow.&nbsp; It made the heat bearable to know that inevitably it would rain. It is scary how much the weather patterns have changed in our lifetime. Thank you for triggering off fond memories.-Pixie van Heerden
