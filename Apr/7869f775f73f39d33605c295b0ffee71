The sporting journey of a Pietermaritzburg father of three, who became a professional archer by default at the age of 50, reached new heights last week. Hayfield resident James O&rsquo;Neill scooped a gold medal at the World Indoor Archery Championships (WIAC) tournament held in Brasov, Romania.O&rsquo;Neill (58), who was introduced to the sport by his 22-year-old son nine years ago, was yesterday still struggling to come to terms with the fact that he was now a world champion.&ldquo;When I entered I also saw the competition as an opportunity for a brief vacation as I had never been to Romania before &mdash; I never thought I would come back a champion.&ldquo;As the competition progressed, I became more confident and once I took the lead I just hung in there,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Neill, who was competing in the veterans category of the tournament said.O&rsquo;Neill, who has to shoot 150 arrows a day to stay at the top of his game, had to throw in everything to be crowned champion.&ldquo;The competition was very stiff &mdash; there was this one guy who kept on breathing down my neck and in the end I beat him by a single point &mdash; it was a close one indeed,&rdquo; he said.A process control technician at Umgeni Water, O&rsquo;Neill knew little about archery before his son, Patrick, a civil engineering student, introduced him to the sport.&ldquo;Once I started practising I never looked back, and I do not see myself retiring any time soon &mdash; the sport has become a very important part of my life. &ldquo;Since I started nine years ago, my concentration has improved and I can focus for far longer periods than before. &ldquo;I have become more productive at work and my energy levels have gone up,&rdquo; he said.Despite joining at a late stage of his life, O&rsquo;Neill was able to make big strides within a short space of time. His passion for the sport has since seen him being elected chairperson of the Pietermaritzburg Archery Club.&ldquo;As chairman of the Pietermaritzburg Archery Club, my main goal is to see more and more local residents taking part in the sport. &ldquo;The sport does amazing things for one&rsquo;s personal development. I know a kid who used to fail at school but started to pass with distinction after joining the sport &mdash; it improves one&rsquo;s concentration tremendously,&rdquo; he said.
