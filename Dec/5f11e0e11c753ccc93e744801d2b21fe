KwaZulu-Natal welcomed 70 babies into the world on Christmas Day this year. According to a statement by KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, by 3 pm on Monday a total of 70 Christmas babies — 38 boys and 32 girls — had been born in the province. However, although there was reason to celebrate, Dhlomo said there was cause for concern too. He urged all pregnant mothers to attend antenatal clinics regularly to ensure early detection of any potential health risks for themselves and their unborn babies. “Not attending antenatal clinics makes the delivery very risky,” said Dhlomo. “Antenatal clinics should be non-negotiable, because when we know your condition as a mother, we detect any challenges early, even if you are HIV positive, we can guarantee your safety and that of your baby.” Dhlomo was also concerned that three of the Christmas Day mothers are 16 years old. “We are always concerned when young people fall pregnant because it is very unsafe,” he said. “If you’re a young person under the age of 18, and you’re delivering a big baby, which does happen, the chances of delivering safely are slim.”  He called on young people to either abstain from sex or use Dual Protection (a combination of condoms and female contraceptive methods) to avoid unplanned or unwanted pregnancies.
