There are more water pipe woes for Pietermaritzburg — this time in the central business district. This week, two businesses complained to The Witness about water constantly spewing onto the road at the intersection of Bulwer Road and Boshoff Street since Tuesday, apparently because of a burst pipe. Both businesses said they had contacted the Msunduzi Municipality’s call centre numerous times to log a complaint, but received no joy. One said they had tried the call centre more than 30 times. “I’m very concerned about the amount of water loss that the city has now incurred from this, and the fact that they [Msunduzi] don’t seem to care at all.” Another said: “Amid a water shortage, we came across a problem [like this]. Water has been gushing [for days]. “Where is the municipality? Why has this not been sorted out as a matter of urgency? Who will pay for all this wasted water? The lack of service delivery in this city is astounding.” A business in Langalibalele Street has complained of alleged unfinished work after a pipe replacement. They said the site was dug up in an operation “two to three months ago”, and is yet to be patched up. They added that efforts to report the problem to the municipality had been uncsuccessful. “Someone could fall inside that hole and get injured. Old people walk up and down here all the time ... I don’t know how they can just leave it like this.” City spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha did not respond to specific questions, but said both complaints would be investigated. Meanwhile, earlier this week, Montrose resident Rex Boreham wrote to The Witness about an unfinished water pipe job off Francis Staniland Road. Rubble and sand was blocking a gutter and most of the left-hand lane of the road. The City’s subsequent response to completing the job coincided with The Witness asking questions last Monday, with the repairs completed a day later, according to Boreham.
