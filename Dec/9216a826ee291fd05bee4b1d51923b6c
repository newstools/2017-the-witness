A 42-year-old Edendale mother of three died in a hail of bullets in the driveway of her home on Thursday morning. Nokuthula Zuma was walking out of her home on her way to work as security guard when the killer walked past and opened fire. Zuma’s partner, Nathi Zitha, said he went outside after hearing shots and then loud screams. “She screamed out for help and then stopped.  “By the time I came out the suspect was long gone and the mother of my children was lying in a pool of blood,” said Zitha. Plessislaer police spokesperson Captain Musa Ntombela said Zuma was shot 11 times, all in her upper body. The motive for the killing is unknown at this stage and no arrests have been yet made. Zitha said witnesses had seen a “suspicious” white Toyota Avanza in the area before Zuma was shot. The driver of the vehicle swung the car around next to where Zuma was standing and a man carrying a gun got out. The man opened fire on Zuma before fleeing on foot.  He was later seen by witnesses getting into the white Avanza, which had parked a few kilometres away. “One of the neighbours said the suspect, who was wearing a balaclava, ran into her yard still carrying the gun.”  Zuma, who worked for Fidelity Security Services in Edendale Road for more than 15 years, survived a previous attempt to kill her, said her sister Nobuhle. In March she was shot six times, also outside her house while waiting for transport to work. She was hit four times on her right leg and twice on her buttocks. Nothing was stolen from her. “She was a people’s person. Always friendly and cheerful. We cannot understand why anyone would want to do this to her,” said Zitha. Zuma leaves a daughter aged 21 and two sons, 17 and 12.
