Winner of this year’s Mandela Day Marathon are running out of patience after waiting for prize money for nearly four months. DA councillor and uMgungundlovu council executive committee member Mike Bond said he had received e-mails from runners about the delayed payments. But the municipality, which organised the August 27 event, said the money will be paid by Monday. Bond pointed to the case of a 72-year-old woman who won the 60-years-and-over category in the 10 km event and was losing hope of ever getting her R1 000 prize money. She had made numerous efforts to contact the organisers but was unable to establish when it would be paid. uMgungundlovu District Municipality spokesperson Mbali Ndlovu said all athletes who participated in the Mandela Day Marathon had signed and accepted the terms and conditions as stated on the entry form. Page four states that “all prizes [trophies] will be issued once all doping and drug testing results have been received and subject to clearance”. It adds that “all prize monies are also subject to RSA tax laws which can also take up to three months to process”. Ndlovu said the drug test results were received in mid-November and banking details of all the winners were recently finalised and verified. “The prize monies were transferred to KwaZulu-Natal Athletics. As per normal, KZNA will issue and administer the payments to all the winners by no later than Monday, 18 December, latest,” she said. Bond said it would have been a lot easier to manage the Mandela Day Marathon if there was a local athletics body to do it. “They would be able to raise and manage payments efficiently,” said Bond.
