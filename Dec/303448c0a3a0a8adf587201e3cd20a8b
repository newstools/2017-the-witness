A SHOP owner was left traumatised after being attacked and robbed inside his Allandale shop early on Thursday morning.  Mohammad Delowar Hossain, a Bangladeshi national, was attacked by three men dressed in blue overalls as he opened his shop, as he always does, at 5.30 am. Video footage seen by The Witness showed one of the three men grabbing Hossain from behind as he unlocked and entered the shop. The other two then join in, forcing him to the back of his shop while continuously beating him on his head and face.  Hossain, who was alone at the time, told The Witness the three had bound his hands and legs, and gagged him so he was unable to scream for help. He said the three made off with about R2 000 in cash and about R3 000 worth of airtime, and also a cell phone.  “I lay and watched. They searched around but it didn’t look like they wanted anything else,” said a visibly shaken Hossain. “Everyone knows I open early because of the taxis that park here so I’m busy. I can’t just stand and sell by the gate because it’s too busy so I have to open the shop at that time.” He said passersby saw him tied up and ran in to free him and someone called the police.  Hossain, who has owned the shop for seven years, said he was almost robbed three months ago, but managed to chase the assailants away using pepper spray.  “I keep this pepper spray and a taser next to the [cash register], but it was too far away when this happened.”  He said he went to a clinic in Raisethorpe and was given pain medication.  Police confirmed the incident.
