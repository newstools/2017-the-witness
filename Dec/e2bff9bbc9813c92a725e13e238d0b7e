Pietermaritzburg - A 17-year-old housebreaking suspect might
have imagined he was Spider-Man when he apparently planned his escape by
leaping from the second floor of the Pietermaritzburg Magistrateâ€™s Court on
Tuesday morning. Instead of landing on his feet and darting out of the front
door, however, he lay writhing in pain on the ground floor, blood spilling from
his head. His hands were still handcuffed behind his back. Inquisitive passers-by immediately gathered around him,
speculating if he was dead and what had transpired. The investigating officer,
who had brought him to court, hurried downstairs and unlocked his cuffs. Court officials were summoned to render assistance and two
arrived wearing latex gloves. They tried to keep the slender young man still and calm. He
complained of pain under one of his arms. He also murmured: "I want to die, just leave me alone." At one stage he sprang to his feet, as if a surge of energy
had entered and travelled through his body. He yelled that he was going away.
Court officials calmed him down and urged him to lie on the floor, fearing he
might injure himself further.  A short while later paramedics arrived and examined him.
They then lifted him onto a stretcher and whisked him away to hospital. Department of Justice and Constitutional Development
spokesperson Mandla Mathebula said the teenager had been arrested for
housebreaking in July in the Plessislaer area. He had been brought to court on Tuesday to see the probation
officer ahead of his trial, which was meant to start on Wednesday. "At 11.05 am, the accused, whose hands were handcuffed to
his back, attempted to escape and then jumped over the rails from the second
floor and landed on the ground floor at the front entrance, inside of the
building." The juvenile sustained injuries to his head and was
bleeding, he said.
