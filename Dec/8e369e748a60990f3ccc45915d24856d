Several suburbs in Pietermaritzburg and parts of Howick were without electricity most of on Sunday after a technical fault at one of the transformers in the Town Bush area. This was confirmed by City spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha, who did not comment further on when the problem would be fixed. A staffer at the City’s call centre said the technical service department was working on restoring the electricity. “We are aware of the power failure that has affected the northwestern areas­ and surroundings. We are sorry about the inconvenience caused but our technical service department is working on fault restoration,” she said. The staffer said she could not say how long it would take to restore the power as it was a “big fault”. Posts on Facebook indicated the power outage in western suburbs like Wembley, Townbush, Oak Park, Athlone and Waltdorf lasted for many hours. Parts of the city centre affected by the cuts included lower Church Street, Hassim Centre and Thomas Street.  Some residents said their calls to the municipal call centre went unanswered, while others said when they did get through, call centre agents could not tell them when the problem would be resolved. “We have been trying to get hold of the municipality using their after hours emergency number but no one answers the phone. The service delivery in this municipality is disgusting. This is not good at all,” said one Athlone resident. The resident said he was without power from midnight on Sunday. A resident of Wembley criticised the municipality on Facebook. “Old Howick Road was without power on Friday for about 10 hours and now again since 12 last night. There is no point in phoning the call centre as we were first told they can only send someone after 8 this morning. “They could not even tell us when we should expect the power to return,” said the resident. Power had been restored to parts of the city by 3.30 pm yesterday and the blackout was expected to be over by the evening.
