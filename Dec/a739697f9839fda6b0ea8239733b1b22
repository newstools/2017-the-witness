LOCAL artist Samukelo Gasa has won the national Bic Pen Art Master 2017 competition.  Gasa (29), of Sweetwaters, won the competition through a public vote, getting 6 000 more votes than the next best contestant. He has won R10 000 in prize money, an online portfolio worth R50 000 and an art hamper from Bic.  He had entered a ballpoint pen drawing called Qhawe, which depicts a young boy. The drawing (seen above) was featured on the front page of The Witness on December 7. Gasa told The Witness on Monday that he never expected to win the competition and his objective was just to make it to the top 20.  “I am very excited about the result. I found out at about 10 am on Bic’s Facebook page, and then I got a phone call from them confirming it.” He said the victory has inspired him to learn about art forms he has yet to explore.  “It has shown me I can do anything. I want to teach myself about the world of art and try to inspire others to develop their skill.” He added: “I want to show young artists, or those who don’t know that they’re good at art, to come out … and bring it forward.” He said a typical artwork of his takes up to 30 hours.  “I work on it over many days, working one or two hours at a time. It takes about four weeks. The toughest part is rendering, which is playing with the details and contrast and so on.” Gasa entered the contest in October, and made the top 20 last month.  He got 15 750 votes in the final round, while the artist in second place got 9 742 votes.
