Residents living in the Chase Valley area are looking for those responsible for a rather &ldquo;neat dump&rdquo; that has come up near Grey&rsquo;s Hospital.Although heaps of rubbish bags usually will have residents fuming and calling on the municipality to intervene, this time, people just want to know who is responsible.One resident, Dr Jason Londt, said some months ago the dump was established on a field between the Grey&rsquo;s Hospital block of flats and Carter High School. &ldquo;There are many clear plastic bags filled with stuff dumped at this site. If this is a recycling exercise it may be commendable,&rdquo; Londt said.After some investigation and confirmation from the Msunduzi Municipality, Witness Warriors can confirm that this indeed is a commendable act.The word &ldquo;dump&rdquo; is used loosely as the waste is actually situated in a cordoned-off zone and the bags are fetched weekly by the municipality.And who can we thank for being so responsible? Grey&rsquo;s Hospital.Msunduzi municipal spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said the area is located on the premises occupied by Grey&rsquo;s Hospital and situated adjacent to the staff residence.It is a paved area that is roughly 300 m&sup2; in extent and is used for the temporary storage of general refuse coming from the hospital.Londt said he wasn&rsquo;t worried that medical waste was being dumped on the site, but &ldquo;the fact that many hadedas and mynas gather at the site on a regular basis suggests that these birds are finding things to eat amongst the matter discarded&rdquo;.But Mafumbatha put that to rest, confirming that all waste material was &ldquo;suitably contained&rdquo; and several inspections conducted by the environmental health unit revealed that there were no offensive conditions prevalent.She said that a separate approved area is provided for all medical waste (which is removed by a specialised medical waste contractor) in terms of the institution&rsquo;s waste management plan and is co-ordinated by a designated and qualified waste management officer.&ldquo;In addition, the area is also serviced by an existing vector control programme,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;The hospital management is currently in talks with the waste management department for a more frequent refuse removal service.&rdquo;So that mystery has been solved and a special thank you to Dr Jason Londt for being a responsible resident, and thank you to Thobeka Mafumbatha for helping us get to the bottom of the investigation.
