With regular customers including Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande at his restaurant, La Vitae owner Tim Lander is adament that the City of Choice is still his number one.&ldquo;I was born in Old Grey&rsquo;s Hospital and went to school at Harburg in Wartburg before studying a Bcomm in accounting at UKZN.&ldquo;I finished my degree in 1999 and in 2000 I travelled to Europe, where I was supposed to drive tractors on farms but ended up grading potatoes and making sandwiches. It was terrible.&ldquo;I was staying with another South African at the time and we went to work at a hotel. I also had experience working in nightclubs before I started working in restaurants and became a ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo; (responsible for the overall dining experience).&ldquo;I stayed in 13 countries in three-and-a-half years before I moved back to South Africa and went to Pretoria and worked at one of the top 15 restaurants in the country, La Pentola, which means &ldquo;international saucepan&rdquo;.&ldquo;I had to work in the kitchen for two months so I knew the food and realised that I really enjoyed working with food.&ldquo;I worked there for seven years before I moved back to Pietermaritzburg and opened Olive and Oil.&ldquo;I then sold Olive and Oil and opened up a restaurant in Hilton called Luminate which I ran for two years before I closed it last year and bought La Vitae.&ldquo;La Vitae is the only restaurant in Pietermaritzburg to be rated five stars on Tripadvisor.&ldquo;We treat people like they want to be treated. We care about people and our overall aim is to make them happy.&ldquo;Some of our regulars include Blade Nzimande, former Maritzburg college head Keith Olivier, DA MP John Steenhuisen and Bill Lambert.&ldquo;With La Vitae, I tried to create an upmarket dining place where we cater for everyone. &ldquo;You can have duck or order pizza, there is something for every occasion.&ldquo;We work with small, local businesses in Pietermaritzburg. &ldquo;It is such a lovely area and there is so much happening with small businesses here.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an inspirational area for food because there is so much fresh produce right here and we like to make our food from scratch.&ldquo;Pietermaritzburg has everything here. We have the Berg, we have some of the best schools in the country. &ldquo;We really have everything.&rdquo;
