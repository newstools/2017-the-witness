The ANC in the province last night called for national structures to investigate ANC MPs who voted with the opposition or abstained during the no-confidence motion.There are 249 ANC MPs in Parliament, however, only 198 MPs voted against the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma in the National Assembly on Tuesday.While there are only 151 opposition MPs, 177 people voted in favour of the motion and nine abstained from voting.Provincial spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli said it was disappointing that there was a possibility of 26 MPs having voted with the opposition.&ldquo;We will leave it to the NEC to investigate the matter. Our view is that anyone who is found to have undermined the party line should be called to order by the relevant structures,&rdquo; he said.In the build-up to the no-confidence motion, ANC MPs including Makhosi Khoza and Derek Hanekom had said they would not vote to keep Zuma in the country&rsquo;s highest office.Moses Mabhida region secretary Mzi Zuma described the results of yesterday&rsquo;s no-confidence vote as a victory for democracy.&ldquo;These motions have no basis and are unfounded. In South Africa we have party political system. People vote for parties and political parties choose members that will represent them.&ldquo;During elections, 11 million people voted for the ANC knowing that President Zuma was the ANC president. This motion was aimed at undermining democracy.&ldquo;We know that the DA have never voted for Zuma. It was hypocritical of them to say they had no confidence in him when they had not voted for him in the first place.&rdquo;He said life had changed for the better for many South Africans since Zuma was elected.&ldquo;Life expectancy has moved from 40 to the late 50s during his tenure. So much focus was put on education both basic and tertiary. This government prioritised R4 billion for funding in tertiary education. That is why we needed to keep the president.&rdquo;Mzi Zuma downplayed the shrinking of numbers between those who were in support and against the motion when compared to previous motions.&ldquo;Even if the difference was one, democracy would have emerged,&rdquo; he said.
