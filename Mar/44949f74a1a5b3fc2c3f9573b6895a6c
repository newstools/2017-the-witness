Restaurant group Spur is again dominating social media platforms &mdash; but this time for a happy reason.Jelena Mandic (29) on Wednesday posted photos of her daughter and a little boy hugging in the play area at Spur in Blackheath, Johannesburg.She posted a tongue-in-cheek comment on Facebook about this spontaneous interaction between a white girl and black boy. This after another parent was banned from all Spurs after he became violent with the mother of a child at Texamo Spur in the Glen shopping centre.The incident sparked a row on social media with allegations of racism from several quarters after Spur released closed circuit television footage of the incident yesterday.&ldquo;Our children are our biggest treasure. They are our future,&rdquo; Mandic posted with her photos.Mandic said she had decided to take her two-year-old daughter Emma for a waffle at the Spur, where she started playing with two other children.She said the little boy gave Emma his balloon and she shared her waffle with him. He also helped her when she slid down the slide.Mandic invited the mother of the boy to contact her so that their two children could play together again, and yesterday someone introduced them.&ldquo;I talked to the boy&rsquo;s mom and we are both overwhelmed by the reaction the photos elicited,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;The funny thing is, she told me her boy sat with his own waffle for about an hour but did not want to take a bite &mdash; but he was very happy to share Emma&rsquo;s waffle when she offered a bite.&ldquo;We will definitely stay in contact and have already agreed to arrange another visit for our children.&rdquo;Mandic posted with the hashtags #thisalsohappenedatSpur #racism&shy;istaught #thisisourfuture on Facebook. Within 12 hours 3 893 people shared the photos and 874 commented.Mmathapelo Bless Molopa commented: &ldquo;This will help to remind people that not everything is negative&rdquo;. Almora Jacobsz praised the parents for the way they are raising their children and said everyone should try harder to eradicate all forms of racism.Bianca Koen commented it was high time for people to put the past behind them and focus together on raising their children&rsquo;s future.Edith Powell said children are naturally colour blind and just want to make friends, adding adults can learn from them.
