Tributes have poured in from Maritzburgers who knew struggle veteran Ahmed Kathrada, who died on Tuesday.Rabia Motala (84), wife of Dr Mahomed &ldquo;Chota&rdquo; Motala, said his death would leave &ldquo;a big gap in our lives&rdquo;. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a friendship from the 50s. From 1956 to 1961 he was with my husband throughout the trial. He even stayed with us in Boom Street. I&rsquo;ll always remember him as part of the family,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope that South Africa remembers him and all that he did for the country &hellip; he was only 35 when he went to jail and was there for 26 years. &ldquo;He was a humble person, down to earth and a close friend &hellip; I can&rsquo;t describe what a wonderful person he was. We will miss him,&rdquo; Motala said. Motala&rsquo;s home was one of three homes in Pietermaritzburg in the &rsquo;90s where politicians who visited from Johannesburg would meet. Babu Baijoo, former speaker of the Msunduzi Municipality, told&nbsp;The Witness&nbsp;that his home and MPL Yusuf Bhamjee&rsquo;s home were the other two &ldquo;meeting venues&rdquo;. &ldquo;It was an honour and privilege to have had Ahmed Kathrada in my home in Orient Heights. I am humbled to have met the man, and read his books,&rdquo; said Baijoo. &ldquo;He is an icon for all of us. He had fantastic ethics and morals and was a great believer in the Freedom Charter,&rdquo; he added. Anant Singh, film producer and CEO of Videovision Entertainment, said that South Africa has lost a father and an inspirational leader among men. &ldquo;In an interview I did with Kathy&rsquo;s mentor, Ismail Meer, he said, &lsquo;Kathy&rsquo;s release from prison on 15 October, 1989 symbolised that nowhere in the world the human spirit could be destroyed by a tyrant or oppressor. He emerged unscathed and ready to serve his people.&rsquo; Kathy continued to do this each day of his life. &ldquo;We salute Kathy for his selfless leadership, his humanity, his quiet dignity and his commitment to the less fortunate people of our country and the world.&rdquo; Kathrada&rsquo;s funeral will take place today at 10 am at the Westpark Cemetery, Beyers Naude Drive, Johannesburg.
