No infighting among yourselves.This was the plea of speaker after speaker during the historic signing of a memorandum of agreement between the Department of Economic Development in KZN, the Commission on Restitution of Land Rights and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, with 16 land claimant communities.Speakers at the ceremony at Golden Horse Casino on Thursday told land claimants that infighting could put assets worth millions of rands at risk.The Hlabisa-Mpukunyoni, Swamp, Zulu and Buthelezi, Mhlaba/Ximba, Dukuduku, Osuthu, Myeni-Nsinde, Tembe, Mthonjaneni, Maphelane, Emasosheni, Kwa Dushu, Rest, Umbumbazi, Umnyengelezi, and Clayborn communities earlier lodged their conservation land claims and their properties are managed by Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife.The agreement affects some parts of iSimangaliso Wetland Park, Umfolozi Park, Ndumo Game Reserve and Tembe Elephant Park.Chief director of restitution Advocate Bheki Mbili said too often communities start fighting among themselves soon after the land is given back to them.&ldquo;Whenever there are delays in land claims, communities unite and the state becomes the enemy. Once you give them land, they start fighting.&ldquo;They can claim 100 hectares of land, then you give them 10 hectares, they will forget about the 90 hectares remaining because they will be busy fighting among themselves for the 10 hectares,&rdquo; he said.Chief land claims commissioner Nomfundo Ntloko-Gobodo reminded claimants that the deal was not for self enrichment of a selected few individuals, but for the benefit of the communities.&ldquo;Please do not start fighting once you hear that money has been deposited into Ezemvelo&rsquo;s account. Do not be like those who would rather have the whole co-management agreement collapse because of infighting.&ldquo;Do not let that old woman who is looking after a young child starve because of infighting. This is the transformation agenda that the president has been speaking about, please make it work,&rdquo; she said.Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife CEO David Mabunda warned that it will be the project that will suffer should there be any quarrelling. &ldquo;This must come to an end. How do you expect us to work with four factions from one area?&rdquo;Mabunda said residents would be allowed to hunt in the area if the hunting would benefit the community. Community members would also be allowed to sell plants if it is for the benefit of the community, he added.
