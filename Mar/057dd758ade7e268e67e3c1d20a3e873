The DA remained optimistic of keeping Ward 32 during the by-election held on Wednesday.The ward became vacant in November last year, three months after the local government elections, when Clive Lotz resigned and joined the ANC.Provincial DA leader Zwakele Mncwango admitted the run-up to the by-election had not been easy.&ldquo;It was a tough campaign and very dirty. But we are positive. We have done our campaign and now it is up to the voters to choose.&rdquo;Deputy provincial leader Mergan Chetty remained in a buoyant mood yesterday as voters flooded into the Woodlands community hall to cast their votes.&ldquo;The sky is blue. The sea is blue. Woodlands is also blue,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The turnout here is fantastic and people have been telling us that they will vote the DA.&ldquo;They want to stop corruption. People here have long been complaining about the monument [next to the community hall] and today they are fixing it because of elections. People have been complaining about houses and nothing has been done until last week when [Human Settlements MEC] Ravi Pillay came here and launched a housing project.&ldquo;People are telling us that they were given food parcels but they are going to vote us because they do not want food for one day, they want to have food every day.&rdquo;EFF candidate Arthur Tissong said he would rather have another political party winning the ward than the ANC.&ldquo;ANC must never take this ward. For 22 years they have done nothing for this community,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It is people who did not belong to any political parties who did things for this community.&ldquo;Win or lose, we are still going to work for this community. We do not buy votes. In this by-election we just want numbers, not a win.&ldquo;We are looking forward to 2019 when we overthrow the ANC,&rdquo; Tissong added.Senior citizen Maria Cassels (91) blasted the current government, saying there is too much corruption.&ldquo;Back then, we never had mjondolo [shacks]; everybody used to have a house. &ldquo;Everybody had work but now there is nothing and our children are getting into drugs. It is like apartheid in reverse,&rdquo; she said.
