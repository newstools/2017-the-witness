Protesters in Bruntville have made serious allegations, claiming that a staggering R35 million has gone missing from the coffers of Mooi-Mpofana Municipality.They are now calling for municipal manager Max Moyo to account for this, saying he has failed to do so thus far.The area has been besieged by protests this week, with roads to Bruntville blockaded with burning tyres and large boulders.On Thursday night the protest reached boiling point as protesters tried to burn down the council chamber.On Friday the municipal offices were closed with a note stuck on the entrance reading: &ldquo;Dear customer, please note that municipal offices will be closed today due to unforeseen circumstances.&rdquo;The council chamber, which had broken windows, was cordoned off with police tape.In Bruntville the protesters continued with their protests.They threw burning tyres, rocks and concrete barricades on to the N3.They also threw stones at cars passing by on the N3.Workers living in the area were barred from leaving the township to get to their jobs.A protester, who asked not to be named, said they will continue protesting until Moyo is fired.&ldquo;He failed to tell a community meeting where the money went. Our municipality owes Eskom a lot of money. They could have used that money to settle the debt.&ldquo;Most of us, the youth, are unemployed. That money would have gone a long way in helping solve this problem.&rdquo;The protester warned that the situation will get worse if their concerns are not addressed immediately.When Weekend Witness phoned Moyo on Friday, he said he was being operated on in a hospital and asked that he be phoned later.Later, his phone was off.ANC regional secretary Mzi Zuma said he was aware that the community members were not happy with Moyo, but said the region will respond fully tomorrow in a community meeting.Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said police were at the scene to monitor the situation. &ldquo;No cases have been opened at this stage,&rdquo; he said.
