Pietermaritzburg - Premier Willies Mchunu&rsquo;s speech received a mixed reaction from political parties.While others &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; it as fair review of the state of the province, others blamed Mchunu for &ldquo;singing the same song&rdquo; that was sung by his predecessor Senzo Mchunu, last year. They criticised Mchunu for not providing any practical solutions to problems being faced by the province.DA caucus leader Francois Rodgers said Wednesday&rsquo;s address showed that people of KZN can no longer rely on the ANC to turn the province around.&ldquo;The premier did not comment on the critical role of the transport sector and related infrastructure needs, ignoring its critical role in kick-starting KZN&rsquo;s economy. &ldquo;As in the case of his predecessors, he also promised radical agrarian transformation. This from a department that has a long-term track record of failing to deliver. He delivered a misleading account of the true state of healthcare in KZN, failing to acknowledge that there is not a single district specialist health team in the province, that infrastructure spend on one single project has caused a ripple effect on equipment procurement and maintenance and that only one third of all clinics in the province are fully accredited in terms of norms and standards,&rdquo; he said.NFP leader at the provincial legislature Vikizitha Mlotshwa said he heard the same song that was sung by the previous premier and blamed Mchunu for not getting to the &ldquo;how&rdquo; part of his speech.&ldquo;As the NFP we are ashamed of the speech that was given by the premier.&rdquo;IFP chief whip Joshua Mazibuko said his party accepted the premier&rsquo;s address as a fair portrayal of the state of the province.&ldquo;It contained positive elements and negative ones. We want to commend him for being honest in that while he articulated the positive elements of the speech, he was also brave enough to say there are shortfalls as well.&ldquo;In particular he did mention that the level of employment is refusing to go down in the province. That is a grave concern,&rdquo; he said.ANC secretary Super Zuma described the speech as comprehensive and well balanced.He said the premier was able to account and report on the progress of implementing what was promised last year. &ldquo;The premier was also able to raise the challenges. He was also able to say what we are going to do,&rdquo; he said.
