Pietermaritzburg - Over R70 000 in cash was stolen during an armed robbery at the Engen garage in Mayors Walk just before midnight on Sunday.Service station manager Anton Meiring said in an interview with The Witness on Mon day he was so distraught that he could not sleep after what had happened.&ldquo;Immediately after I was called by Red Alert, I made my way to the service station. Unfortunately when Red Alert responded, the suspects had fled the scene. &ldquo;The two employees who were on duty were still in shock and were traumatised,&rdquo; he said.Meiring showed The Witness the dramatic CCTV footage which showed the ordeal. A silver Mercedes Benz C class with a GP registration, which was &ldquo;probably a false registration&rdquo;, pulls in and stops in front of the garage shop&rsquo;s entrance. Three armed men wearing balaclavas storm into the shop and force the cashier and the petrol attendant on duty down to the ground. One suspect has a sledgehammer that he uses to break open the safe while the other suspect can be seen taking cash from the till. &ldquo;It was the first time in 80 years &mdash; we have never had a robbery. They attempted to take cigarettes, but failed. They also took two cellphones,&rdquo; said Meiring. Meiring said the staff were shaken, but they understand that it was not an everyday incident.&ldquo;The staff who reported for duty on Monday seemed okay. However, we are definitely looking to tighten the security. We have spoken to Red Alert already. We will install more cameras as well.&rdquo;Police provincial spokesperson Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident and said no shots were fired and no injuries were reported. &ldquo;A case of business robbery was opened at Prestbury police station for investigation,&rdquo; said Zwane.Video: Armed robbery at the Engen garage in Mayors Walk, PMB
