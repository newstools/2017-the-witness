Pietermaritzburg - A single mother went all out and threw a R100 000 birthday party for her four-year-old daughter at her pre-school, Sunnylea Pre-primary School, on Wednesday.Kavitha Nerputh from Newholmes in Northdale said she loves to throw spectacular birthday parties for her children. The outdoor affair was fully decked with colourful decorations, balloons, multiple jumping castles and a marquee for the parents who were all invited to the party.Two horses were present to give the children free rides around the playground. There were clowns, animal balloon twisters, face painters and cartoon mascots who were handing out sweets, dancing with the children and giving them hugs.There was also a full buffet for the adults and a full candy and ice-cream buffet for the little ones.CentrepieceThe centrepiece was of course the enormous four-tier birthday cake with ice-cream cones, candy-coated popcorn and a big cupcake on top.There was so much to do for the children that some seemed overwhelmed and confused about what to do first, where to play and what to eat.The Pietermaritzburg-born and -raised single mother of three said she owns an internationally based company that manufactures and distributes fast moving consumer goods.The whole party was said to initially cost R50 000 but ended up costing R100 000 with the kiddies area alone costing R70 000.Nerputh has three children, the eldest is 19 years old and is studying law, the second child is 16 years old and in Grade 11 and the youngest child is four-year-old Zia. &ldquo;Zia has always had spectacular parties from her first birthday,&rdquo; said Nerputh.She said last year Zia had two big birthday parties, one was here at home and the other was in Hong Kong.No expense sparedNerputh said she spares no expenses for her children and said by hosting such a lavish party she wished to treat all the children and not just her own.&ldquo;For the people who think this is too excessive, that is their problem because they are not paying for it, I am,&rdquo; she said. Judy Raw, one of the mothers who attended the birthday party, said she had never attended such a huge party.&ldquo;Wow! This must be a dream come true for my two children. If you&rsquo;ve got the money as a parent then why not go all out,&rdquo; said Raw.Another mother, Estelle Ferrera, said the party was a wonderful experience for the children whose parents cannot afford to spoil them. &ldquo;This is absolutely great for the underprivileged children who have never been to the circus or experienced such an extraordinary party.&ldquo;It is actually very generous of the mother to want to share all of this with the children and her daughter&rsquo;s friends,&rdquo; said Ferrera.The principal of Sunnylea Pre-primary School and Aftercare Centre Lynn Freestone said Zia&rsquo;s birthday party was so far the biggest party celebration that had been paid for by one parent they had ever had at the school. &ldquo;This is a wonderful carnival celebration for all the 115 children at Sunnylea. Some of the children here have never experienced such a happy festival extravaganza.&ldquo;Thank you to Kavitha for your generosity and open heartedness to all the children here,&rdquo; said Freestone.
