A suspected robber was shot in the leg by the police after he snatched a woman&rsquo;s handbag on Wednesday morning in Northdale.uMgungundlovu North Cluster spokesperson Captain Gay Ebrahim said a woman was walking along Raja Road om Wednesday morning when a young man with a knife snatched her handbag. &ldquo;Fortunately there was a police vehicle in the vicinity and when she started screaming a police officer intervened,&rdquo; said Ebrahim.Ebrahim said the suspected robber ran away into the nearby bush. &ldquo;The police officer followed the suspect into the bush and when the suspect tried to stab the police officer, he shot the suspect on his right thigh,&rdquo; she said.She said the man was treated by paramedics at the scene and taken to Northdale Hospital where he is under police guard. He will be arrested and charged with robbery once he is discharged from hospital.Anesh Singh, who is part of the community-based crime watch group in the area, said they have seen a spike of such robberies and house robberies in the area.&ldquo;The crime levels are just rising and rising. We need the crime minister to intervene and provide support for crime fighting volunteers in communities,&rdquo; said Singh.Singh said he and his brother Kaveer, together with other neighbours, conduct patrols in their residential area and have assisted the police with many arrests.Another member of the community-based crime watch group, Rikeesh Ishwarlall, said his main concern was the overgrown vacant land in the area.&ldquo;These unkept bushy areas next to the residential areas are very problematic as they have become a hide-out place for these criminals.&ldquo;Just recently while we were patrolling we chased a man we suspected might have had intentions to break into someone&rsquo;s house into these bushes. &ldquo;The municipality really needs to intervene. We are trying on our part and we just ask them to at least meet us half way,&rdquo; said Ishwarlall. Singh said he suspects that the robber who was shot and arrested on Wednesday could be the same man they recently helped the police arrest for house robbery in the area about three months ago.
