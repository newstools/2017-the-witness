Pietermaritzburg- After being in charge for less than three months, one victory, one draw and five losses in all competitions, Maritzburg United coach Roger de Sa has officially quit.There is speculation that De Sa may be linked to the vacant Bafana Bafana coaching job but club chairperson Farook Kadodia said the coach told him he was resigning as a result of &ldquo;family commitments&rdquo; in Cape Town.Kadodia said he would be disappointed if De Sa was appointed coach of the South African football team on Tuesday or if he took up a position anywhere other than in Cape Town.There was a sombre mood at the Maritzburg United offices in Pietermaritzburg yesterday following the abrupt resignation of the head coach.Kadodia said his ailing side will have to get on with life without &ldquo;one of the biggest fish in the sea&rdquo; &mdash; as he had described him when he was first unveiled as the new coach &mdash; if they are to survive the dreaded axe come the end of the 2016/17 Absa Premiership season.&ldquo;The coach&rsquo;s resignation has caught us by surprise. We have been patient with him, and allowed him time to settle down with the team as we would any new coach. We were not even pressuring him about the results. In our discussions, we had spoken about getting past the first four games, and thereafter, getting the results,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;When I spoke to him before he accepted our offer &mdash; he had a situation at home that he wanted to sort out first which is why the deal was delayed, otherwise he would have been here in the first week of December,&rdquo; said Kadodia.He said the club&rsquo;s previous coach, Ernst Middendorp, resigned and three weeks later he was the head coach in Bangkok. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s how football is and we have to see this as water under the bridge and move forward.&rdquo;The former Ajax Cape Town mentor took over from assistant coach Fadlu Davids in January on a six-month contract with a two-year option to renew, after leaving his post at the Urban Warriors.With the 52-year-old tactician now gone, Davids will be back in the Maritzburg hot seat again, on an interim basis until the end of the season.David&rsquo;s record, when Middendorp jumped ship in late November, was five wins from five games.Maritzburg are currently placed 10th in the top flight standings, with 23 points from 21 matches and will resume their quest for a top-eight finish next weekend when they host Ajax Cape Town at the Harry Gwala Stadium.Kickoff is at 8.15 pm.
