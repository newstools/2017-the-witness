Durban athlete Carl Hansen&rsquo;s first Comrades marathon run from Durban to Pietermaritzburg was sealed with an &ldquo;I do&rdquo;.Hansen (38) created a stir at the finish line when he got down on one knee and proposed to his long-time girlfriend, Nicole Fairchild Matthews (26), soon after he completed the race at the Scottsville Racecourse.Speaking to The Witness, Hansen said he had planned the proposal a few months ahead of the marathon.&ldquo;I e-mailed Comrades to ask for permission to run with the banner and also requested for them to organise for the announcer to read my banner as I approach the finish line.&rdquo;Hansen took spectators, runners and media by surprise with his brave proposal.Matthews was left speechless when she saw Hansen get down on one knee at the finish and pop the big question.&ldquo;He told me I had won a competition to be at the finish line. I saw him approaching and got excited and asked a photographer to take a picture of him when he got to the finish.&ldquo;I was stunned when I heard the announcer call out my name, obviously reading the banner Carl was running with.&rdquo;The blushing bride-to-be said she burst into tears when she saw Hansen get down on one knee and immediately gave him a guaranteed &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.&ldquo;It has not sunk in yet. We have been getting a lot of congratulatory messages on social media, it&rsquo;s overwhelming.&rdquo;The couple said they have not decided on the date for the wedding, but &ldquo;we are looking forward to the rest of our lives together&rdquo;.
