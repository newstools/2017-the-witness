The National Energy Regulator of SA (Nersa) has confirmed that it has been inundated with calls from Msunduzi residents with regard to power outages.Spokesperson Charles Hlebela said after lights went out for four days in Hilton and Sweetwaters, Msunduzi residents turned to the energy regulator&rsquo;s complaints department to call for intervention.&ldquo;More than 50 complaints were received,&rdquo; said Hlebela, adding that Nersa was now in talks with Msunduzi regarding the power outages.The City, already in the midst of an electricity crisis linked to a labour despute, could find itself in trouble with Nersa.Msunduzi residents asked Nersa to investigate whether the city had contravened the licence regulations by failing to restore power timeously, allowing a four-day outage.The residents had also complained about the City&rsquo;s call centre, which they said was dysfunctional.According to Electricity Regulation Act 4 of 2006, if it is found a licencee has contravened or failed to comply with a licence condition or any provision of the act, the regulator may serve a notice on the licencee directing the licencee to comply with the licence condition or the provision of the act, as the case may be, within a reasonable period specified in the notice. If the licencee fails to comply with the notice, the regulator may impose a penalty of 10% of the annual turnover of the licencee or R2 million (whichever is the higher amount) per day commencing on the day of receipt of the notice.Hlebela said Nersa would investigate whether Msunduzi had violated the conditions of its licence and that this would take four months.&ldquo;According to Nersa&rsquo;s complaints resolution procedure, it takes 120 working days to resolve a complaint,&rdquo; he said.
