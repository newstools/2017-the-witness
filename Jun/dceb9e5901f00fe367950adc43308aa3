A mother and her two children from Thembalihle informal settlement were left destitute after a candle fire destroyed all their belongings on Tuesday.Nokuthula Mofokeng and her family had been without electricity for two weeks due to a faulty transformer feeding power to the area.&ldquo;I came home from work to find that everything we owned had been destroyed,&rdquo; she said.From what Mofokeng gathered, her young daughters forgot to put the candle out before going outside to play.&ldquo;We suspect the blaze was started by a candle.&ldquo;If the electricity in the area was restored on time this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened. Community members had to protest first before the issue of electricity was sorted out,&rdquo; Mofokeng said.She said she has been staying with friends and good Samaritans have been helping with food.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even have a bed to sleep on, clothes, I don&rsquo;t have anything. I don&rsquo;t know how the children will go back to school next month. Their school bags and uniforms we also destroyed.&ldquo;Luckily I had my ID and bank cards with me.&rdquo;Mofokeng said she had been living in the one-room house for the past year and hoped to at least move back in after the landlord fixed the door and windows.&ldquo;Luckily they managed to put out the fire soon otherwise other rooms would have been affected.&rdquo;
