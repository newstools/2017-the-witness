&ldquo;A few weeks ago I came home to a lifeless child, by all accounts dead, and today I am here playing hide and seek with my son.&rdquo;A month after two-year-old Elijah Abrahams was rushed to hospital in a critical condition after he was found floating lifelessly in the family&rsquo;s pool, parents, Simone and Kelvin Abrahams say their son is &ldquo;better than ever&rdquo;.Elijah was found by his sister who rushed to alert her mother, Simone.After pulling him out of the pool, Simone and a neighbour immediately began CPR on him before her husband, Kelvin arrived and took over.Kelvin, who is trained in CPR, worked on Elijah until paramedics from Netcare911 arrived and told Kelvin to continue while they set up a heart monitor and ventilator for Elijah.He was rushed to hospital and was eventually discharged on June 9, with doctors saying if the Abrahamses had not started CPR on Elijah immediately, he would not have survived the ordeal.Speaking to The Witness yesterday, Kelvin said his son had made a &ldquo;miraculous recovery&rdquo;, exceeding expectations of doctors and physiotherapists who had treated him.&ldquo;The doctors were astounded by his improvement,&rdquo; he said.Kelvin said the MRI scan came back completely clear and the infections in his chest and lungs had cleared up almost overnight.&ldquo;He is doing so well,&rdquo; said Kelvin.&ldquo;He is riding his bike every day and playing with the dog and we are really humbled by God&rsquo;s favour toward our family.&rdquo;He said people from all over the world, including America, the UK and Australia, had been sending messages of support and prayer to his family.&ldquo;God was there at every turn.&rdquo; Kelvin said he and Simone wanted to thank those at the Mediclinic emergency centre as well as paediatrician Dr Bisseru who kept the family updated at every step and cared for Elijah around the clock.He also thanked the physiotherapist who worked with Elijah as well as his church and friends and family. &ldquo;We were never alone on this journey. We always had someone with us,&rdquo; he said.
