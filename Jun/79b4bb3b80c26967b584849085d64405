Paramedics responding to an emergency at the Timber Door Manufacturers (TDM) factory on Chesterfield Road were caught in a standoff with protesting workers on Wednesday. Sabelo Ngubane, who is believed to be in his 30s, was injured when his right arm was crushed in the finger-joint machine.Police had to fire rubber bullets when the angry protesters blocked the gate and obstructed the ambulance from leaving with the critically injured man.The protesting workers were fired after an unlawful strike, reportedly sparked by the dismissal of a black shop steward who had been called a &ldquo;baboon&rdquo;. On their notification of dismissal, signed by company chief executive officer Chris du Toit, the company said the workers had been fired for participating in an unprotected strike. Du Toit declined to comment on the workers&rsquo; allegations.A paramedic who attended the scene said the striking workers blocked the ambulances and started throwing stones at the vehicles and security guards at the entrance of the factory. &ldquo;We requested for a helicopter from Durban but it couldn&rsquo;t come out. Fortunately police managed to disperse the crowd and the patient was rushed to ... surgery.&rdquo;Acting factory manager Raymond Kritzinger said workers who embarked on the illegal protest blocked both exits and the paramedics were stuck inside with the injured worker. &ldquo;It was a very bad incident. His co-workers managed to rush to his aid. The ambulance was here within minutes, but on their way out they were blocked.&rdquo; Kritzinger said they still have to investigate how the incident happened. &ldquo;We have a new work force so most of them are still learning how to use the machinery,&rdquo; he said.
