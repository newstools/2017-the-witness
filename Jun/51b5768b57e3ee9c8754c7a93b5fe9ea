Brutal killings of young women that have shocked the country recently serve as a &ldquo;tragic reminder&rdquo; to the Bhamjee family of their own loss.The family is still looking for closure following the death of well-known gynaecologist Dr Sabera Bhamjee.They were reflecting while the country mourned the deaths of Karabo Mokoena, who was killed and burned before being dumped in Johannesburg, and three-year-old Courtney Pieters, who was poisoned and raped before her attacker broke her bones and dumped her in the veld last month.Best friends Bongeka Phungula and Popi Qwabe&rsquo;s bodies were also found last month in Soweto and Tladi respectively.These are just some of the crimes that have shaken South Africans in recent times.More than a decade has passed and the Bhamjee family are still searching for answers after the brutal murder of the award-winning gynaecologist.Bhamjee, wife of former uMgungundlovu District Mayor Yusuf Bhamjee, was stabbed more than 60 times in her room in the St Anne&rsquo;s Medical Centre on June 2, 2006, while she was alone during lunch time.Now, after years of police investigations and wild goose chases, the well-loved doctor&rsquo;s killers are yet to be arrested.Speaking to Weekend Witness, Bhamjee said the manner in which women are brutalised sends a &ldquo;shiver down my spine&rdquo;.&ldquo;It serves as a gruesome reminder of the tragedy my family had to endure,&rdquo; he said.Bhamjee said he identified with the families of those women who were violently killed in the last few months in the country.&ldquo;We will not heal until we find that closure we are looking for and I feel what those families are going through,&rdquo; Bhamjee said.In a previous article, the ANC stalwart spoke to Weekend Witness about how he and his daughters, Suhayfa and Sameera, still search for closure.&ldquo;The worst is when people ask me if any arrests have been made. I know they ask out of concern but it just brings back so many memories of a terrible time in our lives and it is a painful exercise to tell them nothing has happened,&rdquo; said Bhamjee.He described his late wife as a humble, timid and petite woman who was very decisive and principled in her life.&ldquo;It is hard to imagine who would want to do this to her. One thing that keeps our family going are the wonderful memories she left us with.&rdquo;Bhamjee reminisced about his daughters&rsquo; weddings, which he said were probably the final most memorable and happy moments they shared.He and his wife shared a very close relationship, having courted each other for seven years before getting married in 1977.&ldquo;She was a wonderful wife and mother. She was also well-loved by the community and delivered many babies. She left her mark and it showed in the way the community supported us through the years,&rdquo; he said.
