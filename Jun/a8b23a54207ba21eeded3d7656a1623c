Maritzburg United managing director and chairperson Farook Kadodia is keeping his cards close to his chest as speculation continues to grow over the possibility of caretaker coach Fadlu Davids taking on the vacant head coaching position at the club on a full-time basis.The Team of Choice lost two coaches last season, first Ernst Middendorp in November last year and then Roger de Sa in March, and both times Davids had to keep the ship on course.And, with a permanent appointment expected in two weeks, Davids appears to be the obvious shortlisted candidate for the job following his two stints, which left many impressed with his brand of football that has seen the club cement their best ever finish in the league.&ldquo;I think basically, our desire is to make the announcement in the next two weeks regarding the head coaching position. There&rsquo;s a lot of pressure from various sectors of support and footballing people understandably, with the kind of results that Fadlu has brought to the team. But everybody must understand that before making a careful decision in that situation. I have to sit with the coach and support him.&rdquo;&nbsp;Since taking charge, Davids has outperformed both previous coaches in results, winning six of 12 games and drawing four while only two resulted in defeats. He was notably also &nbsp;named PSL Coach of the Month for April.Middendorp won two of 11&sbquo; drawing five and losing four, while De Sa managed just one win in seven matches in all competitions.Speaking to The Witness, an adamant Kadodia said he had seen this movie before where an assistant coach was given the role in a permanent basis and it turned out to be a disaster.&ldquo;Fadlu is a very young coach and he needs some protection around him. There are going to be situations that we&rsquo;ve seen in the past where the club basically engaged another assistant coach and promoted him to be the head coach. It didn&rsquo;t work at the time. One must be guarded about that situation but again there are a lot of positives that are going for coach Fadlu, in the sense that he had two spells in the one season as a head coach and excelled in both stints,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.Mandla Ncikazi served as an assistant coach during Steve Komphela&rsquo;s tenure at the club and took over as head coach when Komphela departed for Kaizer Chiefs prior to the 2015/16 campaign.He stayed at the helm for just five matches, a 5-3 extra time loss to Amakhosi in the quarter-finals of the MTN8, three league defeats and a draw.The string of poor results resulted in him being shown the exit door.&ldquo;This whole idea of getting him promoted as the head coach is a process and we need to make sure that he is given the proper support. If he continues with the work ethic that he has, I believe that he has a long road as a footballing coach and we&rsquo;d like that to be fulfilled properly. Unfortunately football is controlled by coaches that produce results and football that fans want,&rsquo;&rsquo; he added.Kadodia is also aware of the 36-year-old&rsquo;s desire to complete his Uefa A coaching licence and fully supports him in that regard.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need to sit with him and make sure that he&rsquo;s comfortable in accepting the job and make provision if he does take this job, that we give him time to complete his Uefa coaching licence, which he is quite determined to do. So all these factors need to be brought about.&rdquo;Davids has signalled his intention to take the coaching reins on a permanent basis next season with the players responding well to his tactics, also confirming that talks between the two parties are under way.
