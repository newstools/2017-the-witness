With a household name like DJ Kabila, one immediately anticipates a massive following and an immense crowd dancing to house music.Being a superstar you&rsquo;d expect ego and arrogance, yet you don&rsquo;t find that in Kabila. Instead, he is absorbed in youth development programmes, where he is working in collaboration with the Department of Arts and Culture to teach the youth about the nitty-gritty of the music industry.Kabila, real name Siyanda Makanya, is a South African deejay hopping between Durban and Pretoria with his roots in the dusty township of Mthatha. Kabila&rsquo;s love for the deejay box dates back to the late nineties. He has an undisputed gift for keeping a jam-packed dance floor on its feet the entire night.Prior to a car accident that left him wheelchair-bound in 1999, Kabila was famous for not only being a music genius behind the decks but also for being a phenomenal dancer. This is still evident in the manner in which he dances in his wheelchair.That being the greatest regret that resulted from his accident, the ever-radiant and witty Kabila&rsquo;s love for music remains unmatched. It was exactly two months after his accident that he started exploring his talent with beats. His ability to rise above the life-changing ordeal is remarkable.Kabila&rsquo;s contribution came about when he started hosting his concept &ldquo;Music Will Save the Day Experience&rdquo;, which is an annual event that celebrates his milestone in music.Kabila has been booked a number of times in the city by different event organisers. And every year, Kabila receives a great deal of requests from upcoming artists to help them secure gigs and assist them in getting their music played on the radio. Artists also seek information on how they can get their brands to the position Kabila has managed to get to, and how to share the stage with the best in the music industry.Kabila said: &ldquo;With the concept that I started, I then decided to grow it and add the music workshop element to equip the young and upcoming artists to reach the highest level possible in the music industry and also know the business side of things.&rdquo;Kabila will host his first free music workshop at Winston Churchill Theatre, 21 Leinster Road in Scottsville, on June 23 from 10 am to 5 pm, with registration from 8 am until 10 am. The music workshop will be divided into three sessions and will feature experienced deejays and artists, record labels and legendary event organisers. The workshop will cover some of the following topics: music development, brand building and management, PR and marketing, live events, digital distribution and publishing, media and entertainment, and the legacy of some of the well-respected people in the music industry who Kabila feels can add value in shaping the young stars.Apart from establishing his company, Musiq Soldier Entertainment in 2007, Kabila also founded the DJ Kabila Foundation aimed at developing schools for the physically disabled and he subsequently identified a beneficiary, The Mason Lincoln Special School in Emalandeni, V Section, Umlazi Township in Durban.One of Pietermaritzburg&rsquo;s biggest annual house events, the Annual Music Experience, which has been happening for the past five years, hosted at 033 Lifestyle in Imbali, will take place on June 24 with DJ Kabila, Culoe De Song, Ralf Gum, Claude, Sir LSG, DJ Bubbles and King Sfiso among those performing.
