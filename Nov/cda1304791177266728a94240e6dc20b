Msunduzi Mayor Themba Njilo has personally vowed to have piles of soil in Belfort cleared after reading about it in The Witness.  On Monday morning Njilo personally visited Himalaya Road, where heaps of soil were left after City workers replaced pipes earlier this year.  The Witness reported on Monday that residents had complained of “lazy” City workers, assigned to clear up the mess, who allegedly take several breaks and leave the site early. They also feared heavy rains could cause the soil to clog nearby storm­water drains.  DA councillor for Ward 28 Claudell Chetty claimed she had received “telephonic promises” from the City to sort out the problem, but nothing had happened. Njilo said on Monday: “Every day I open The Witness to see what is affecting people. So I saw that article and I went to the site at about 7 am [on Monday].”Njilo met residents to speak about the problem.  He then contacted City workers and ordered them to immediately clear the heaps of earth. Resident Ahmed Khan, who met with Njilo, said he had discussed numerous issues with him.  “He told me that the situation was concerning. We spoke about the possibility of the stormwater drain being blocked and he agreed it could be a concern.” Khan said: “I also told the mayor about the [public] park behind my house where the grass is unkempt. I said I managed to get [municipal] workers to come out, but they only cut a portion of the grass. I told him about that and he said he didn’t like things like that.” Khan said he was pleased that Njilo had come to personally inspect the site.  “The man came in good faith, and we have to give him credit for that. If he didn’t care, he wouldn’t have bothered coming here. He really didn’t have to come out himself, but he did.”
