UKZN Pietermaritzburg campus’s Tshegofatso Molefe is the only student from KwaZulu-Natal to make it into the Justice Pageant SA finals. The 22-year-old law student is now preparing for the grand finale of the competition in Johannesburg later this month.  The Justice Pageant SA is a beauty competition but is also aimed at developing moral character in South African schools and communities. Molefe said the reason she entered the Justice Pageant is because it embodies values that she upholds. “I was just taking a chance when I applied, I never thought I will make it to the finals, I am so happy about it,” said Molefe. “I have won six titles before, but I never thought things will get this serious for the Justice Pageant SA,” she said. Molefe said as part of the competition they had to do tasks, including going to schools, Facebook challenges and social debates. She said there were 25 contestants in competition, and 12 were chosen to compete at the finals. She is the youngest contestant in the competition. “The pageant required us to visit one school per week since the beginning of the year and present the teachings of the No Crime Culture,” said Molefe.
