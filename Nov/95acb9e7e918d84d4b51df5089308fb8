Pietermaritzburg police made a big breakthrough on a criminal syndicate operating in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday afternoon. Working together, various police units recovered three firearms, one allegedly a state-issued police gun, implements believed to be used in car breakings and a car box computer overriding system. Police, including the K9 unit, Flying Squad and Rapid Response unit, raced to a car wash in Slangspruit after receiving information that three cars, carrying guns, were driving around the Imbali area­. They were told the cars had stopped at a carwash in Slangspruit, however, the vehicles had been abandoned when police arrived. The cars — a white BMW, Kia Picanto and VW Polo — have allegedly been used for criminal activity in the area. A source said the BMW was believed to have been used during the hijacking of a police officer who had been parked in Alexandra Park last Friday evening. The policeman’s vehicle was later recovered. According to the source, in each vehicle was a 9mm firearm, one of which belonged to a police officer. The serial number had been removed. It is also believed that one of the 9mm firearms was used during an armed robbery in Plessislaer in 2015. Sources have described the recovery of the weapons, vehicles and car breaking tools as a breakthrough. They said the recovered items belong to a syndicate involved in hijackings and armed robberies in the Edendale and Imbali area. All three vehicles, the firearms and car breaking tools were taken by police for DNA testing and fingerprinting. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said last night that the suspects in the case were still being sought but “arrests are imminent”. She confirmed that three unlicensed firearms, more than 80 rounds of ammunition, cellphones and car breaking implements were found inside the vehicles.
