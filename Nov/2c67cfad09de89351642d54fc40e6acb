Motorists driving along Himalaya Road in Belfort have for months been confronted by debris spilling onto the road because of an allegedly shoddy repair job to the adjacent pavement by Msunduzi Municipal workers. Residents also bemoaned “lazy” city workers who were assigned to clear up the mess — they allegedly take several breaks per day and then leave the site early. The debris was apparently caused by an operation to replace water pipes underneath a portion of the pavement on Himalaya Road. DA councillor for Ward 28 Claudell Chetty claimed “telephonic promises were made” by the City to sort out the problem, but those had not been forthcoming. City spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha did not respond to detailed questions sent last week, but said the matter would be investigated. Resident Ahmed Khan said the debris spilling onto the road, which is situated at a bend, has been a problem for about three months. “The road is already narrow, and now cars only have half the road to drive along.” He fears nearby stormwater drains on the road could become clogged, should the frequent rains that Pietermaritzburg has seen lately persist. “Staff come to work at 10.30 am, take an hour’s breakfast break. Thereafter [they] take a nap and then work for an hour. They eat lunch and leave at 2.30 pm,” he said. A disgruntled Khan said he had tried numerous times to complain to the City, but was always “given the runaround”. “The one department refers you to the other department and then back again. No one wants to say it’s their responsibility.” Chetty said she had tried to get the City to remove the debris from the road. She said that several e-mails went unanswered. “I did a site visit with the residents to assist them with issues they face due to the project,” she said. “Residents have the right to engage with the paper. They are the ratepayers of this city. I will follow up on this issue and give a progress report to the community of the area,” she added.
