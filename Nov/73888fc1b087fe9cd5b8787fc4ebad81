For four years an Underberg pensioner has suspected that people he knows have claimed life insurance money by somehow obtaining a death certificate for him. In 2013, Gogo Lazarus Nzuza (77) discovered that a death certificate was made out in his name when he went to Home Affairs to obtain personal documents. He opened a case of fraud but to this day the police’s investigation into the matter has come to nothing. Police confirmed that the case has been closed until new evidence emerges. After The Witness inquired about the case, Home Affairs spokesperson Thabo Mokgola confirmed they would launch an investigation to get to the bottom of the matter. He said any officials found to have been acting unlawfully would be dealt with. A bewildered Nzuza said this week that he was upset that he has no answers for why the death certificate exists. He claimed, however, that three people he knows could be behind it. The pensioner also claimed that people have been sent to kill him and he had to beg for his life. He fears they might have been sent by the same people who obtained a death certificate for him. “I had to move from my own home in Bulwer to go and rent a place elsewhere as I feared for my life,” said Nzuza. “I still live in fear because I know that these people could find me and kill me knowing that I am already certified dead,” he added. Nzuza said he used to live a normal life but this changed when he found out he was listed as a deceased person at Home Affairs. “Every time I apply for something, I always pray that they do not tell me that I am dead, according to their system. “This situation has ruined my life completely and the fact that I cannot find help is what makes it even worse,” he added. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of fraud was opened at Folweni police station but no arrests have been made.
