The family of a young Copesville woman whose body was found in a sewer in 2014 will have to wait until next year for her alleged killer to stand trial after the case was postponed again on Monday. Letisha Naidoo (20) was allegedly raped and murdered three years ago, almost to the day. On trial for the crimes is her alleged former boyfriend Christopher Sabbadu (24). Sabbadu, of Northdale, appeared briefly in the Pietermaritzburg high court on Monday facing two counts of rape and one of murder. He was remanded in custody until January for trial. It is alleged in the state’s indictment that Sabbadu and three others, who were armed with knives, lured Naidoo to a secluded area on Mysore Road in Northdale where two of them repeatedly raped her. She was also allegedly throttled and stabbed several times before her body was wrapped in plastic and dumped in a nearby sewer canal. There have been numerous delays in finalising the trial to date. These were due to various reasons including a change of lawyer, Sabbadu’s admission to Fort Napier hospital for a mental assessment and when the judge previously presiding over the matter recused himself. Naidoo’s father, Steve, told The Witnessoutside court yesterday that he is having trouble sleeping because of the lack of closure in the case. “I’ve lost my wife, two sons and [Letisha]. I brought her up on my own, I worked three shifts to support her. “I would leave her with neighbours while I worked. All I wanted was to see her future, and this was the end I had to see.” He added: “She was a good child. I have three or four albums full of photos of her.” Showing a reporter a scrapbook of newspaper clippings, court papers and photos of Naidoo, he bemoaned the number of delays. “I just want this case to continue.” Sabbadu is scheduled to appear for trial on January 29 next year.
