A 25-year-old Pietermaritzburg man — said to be “religious and playing a role in the church” — is to stand trial on 24 charges of sexually molesting young boys. It is alleged the man raped and sexually abused 18 young boys, one of whom who was only eight years old at the time. The short, slight man — who cannot be named until he pleads to the charges — appeared before Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Shyam Gyanda on Tuesday and was served with an indictment detailing the charges against him. A source told The Witness the accused was to have appeared in the high court on Monday “but he didn’t come because he has other cases and was appearing in another court”. The trial has been set down from May 21 next year.  The alleged crimes were committed in June/July 2016 in the France area of Pietermaritzburg, in September 2016 in Ndeleni near Richmond and in February this year in Illovo, Amanzimtoti. The accused lived in all three areas during those times and, according to the indictment, would “lure the children to his residence enticing them with cellphones, a tablet, videos and games”. “All the children were schooling ... he was regarded as a religious person, playing a role in the church.” His alleged victims are aged between eight and 14. All are expected to testify at the trial, which has been set down for five weeks. According to the indictment, the man preyed on children who walked past his house on their return from school. He would invite them in, lock the door, force them to participate in sexual acts and then rape them. One of his alleged victims, who is 14, claims that the accused and another man “took turns” raping him. The man is in custody at Westville prison.
