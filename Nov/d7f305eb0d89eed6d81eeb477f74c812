Prestbury residents fear that their substation could soon be crushed by a rotting tree after it was damaged in a fire some months ago. Despite numerous attempts, they have not been able to get the Msunduzi Municipality to intervene.  The tree on Milliken Road caught alight about six months ago, and has deteriorated to the point where residents believe it is “just a strong wind away from falling”.  The tree’s trunk had been completely hollowed-out by the fire, and several large branches have broken off it.  One resident who lives near the tree said the recent rains and strong winds caused a crack to form at the base of the tree. He said he has tried for about three months to get the City to cut it down, to no avail.  “I have phoned them numerous times. You can never get through; the phone just rings and rings and then all of a sudden the call cuts.” The resident fears the tree is bound to fall soon, especially with the recent stormy weather Pietermaritzburg has seen. “I think it will fall on that substation, and if not it will fall on someone’s driveway. Either way, it will be a big problem.”  City spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha did not respond to a detailed query yesterday, but did say the matter would be investigated.
