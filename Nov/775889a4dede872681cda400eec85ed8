Four men accused of murdering Edendale hospital nurse Nompumelelo Ngubane (38) are staying behind bars for the time being. The suspects include Jabulani Sithole (43), the man Ngubane was allegedly due to marry the day after she disappeared and was later found murdered. Sithole is charged with her murder in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court together with Kwanele Shoba (22), Sanele Zondi (18) and Sfiso Mkhize (23). When the four appeared in court on Thursday to launch a bail application they heard they will remain in custody until they next appear on November 23. Police investigations continue. Magistrate M. Boikhutso said that the investigating officer in the matter needed to provide the court with a document to prove an allegation that Shoba has a pending theft charge facing him. Shoba’s legal representative told the court that her client disputes he has this pending case against him. Boikhutso also ordered the investigating officer to verify the home addresses of Shoba, Zondi, and Mkhize before the bail application proceeds. Ngubane’s body was discovered in her car in KwaPata on August 18, the eve of her wedding day. She had been strangled. Her family told The Witness there was a belt around her neck, and her face was covered with her head scarf. Her mother, Ntombifikile, said Ngubane had left home that morning to go to the hair salon and to fetch her wedding gown in the CBD.  The family had not met her fiancé. Prior to her murder, the family said Ngubane had been receiving ominous messages on WhatsApp demanding she should cancel the wedding “or die”.
