The family of the Pietermaritzburg man who was killed by a police officer in an alleged “road rage” incident say they are glad that the matter is finally to be put to rest. Judgment is expected in the trial of Thobelani Khuzwayo, a former police officer, next Wednesday — a week before the three-year anniversary of Kavlin Naidoo’s death in hospital from a gunshot wound.  It is alleged that Khuzwayo shot Naidoo (27) in the stomach in the CBD in 2014. Khuzwayo has said he fired the shot that struck Naidoo because he believed he was about to become the victim of a hijacking. In final arguments on Thursday, the state said that Khuzwayo’s versions of events during the trial changed “drastically” from the explanation he gave when he pleaded, and that his story was “fraught with inconsistencies”. Khuzwayo faces a charge of murder and one of defeating the ends of justice, for allegedly opening a false case of robbery.  Khuzwayo, who delivered his own closing arguments after his advocate, Brad Osborne, withdrew from the case on Wednesday, termed the charge of defeating the ends of justice “a disgrace”. He said the state did not prove this charge against him beyond reasonable doubt. He disputed the accounts given by state witnesses about what happened. Naidoo’s mother, Patsy, said she is happy judgment is not far way.  “The anniversary of his [Kavlin’s] death is November 22. It will be put to rest by then and we’ll have closure.” Kavlin’s aunt, Kamla, said he was an affable man who lived life to the fullest.
