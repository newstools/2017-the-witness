A 19-year-old from Edendale was left fighting for his life after
he was allegedly doused with a flammable liquid — believed to be petrol — and
set alight. Plessislaer police station
spokesperson Captain Musa Ntombela said a case of attempted murder had been
opened but no arrests had been made yet. In the incident at the weekend
Philani Mlotshwa, a high school pupil at Smero Secondary School, was allegedly
set alight by a friend after an argument over an Adidas jacket. His mother, Pretty Mlotshwa,
said her son was at a shop near their home playing pool when he was approached
by his attacker. “According to bystanders, the
attacker stood outside the gate at the shop carrying a litre of what looked
like petrol and called out for my son.” She said the bystanders told
her they heard the attacker saying: “I have been looking for you”. “They say after a short
conversation he then proceeded to demand Philani take off his jacket and give
it to him. “When Philani refused, he was
seen pouring liquid on him and then he took out a cigarette lighter and burned
him.” Mlotshwa said her son attempted
to escape but the attacker ran after him and continued pouring the liquid on
him. The distraught mother said she
was shocked when she was told Philani had been rushed to hospital. “When I arrived at the hospital
he looked like he was in so much pain. The skin on his chest, back and part of
his arms had peeled off. It was a horrible sight.” Mlotshwa said the attacker and
her son went to the same school and had been friends. She said her son spent three
days in the intensive care unit but on Tuesday was moved to a general ward
where he is currently recovering. “He is still unable to talk at
the moment. The doctors have kept him sedated so I haven’t been able to speak
to him to find out what really happened.”
