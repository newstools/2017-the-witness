DESPITE universities saying they are full and will not be considering walk-ins, desperate students were still seen standing in long queues hoping to hand in their applications.Every January, thousands of students flock to tertiary institutions and stand in long queues in hopes of securing a place to study as many students fail to apply and some leave it too late.Samantha Pango from Nelspruit in Mpumalanga was among several hopeful students standing in the long first-year application queue at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) in Scottsville on Tuesday.Pango said she had applied to many different universities but had not received any replies.&ldquo;This is all so very stressful. I had just been to the UKZN Howard campus where I was told there were no spaces left and advised to come try here,&rdquo; said the frustrated Pango.She said she had initially wanted to study LLB (a bachelor in law) but will now settle for a bachelor in social science.&ldquo;I just hope I get space for this year because I can change to LLB next year if my results are good enough,&rdquo; said Pango.Nokwethemba Miya from Durban said she was at the UKZN PMB campus to put in her late application as she was not accepted for nursing because she did not place it as her first option on her Central Applications Office (CAO) application.&ldquo;I will apply for anything in humanities. It is not what I wanted to study but it&rsquo;s better than nothing,&rdquo; said Miya.Rivalan Pillay of Pietermaritzburg was also at the UKZN PMB campus queue with his mother hoping to put in a late application to study B.Com general. Pillay told The Witness that he had not applied through CAO because he initially had no plans of going to varsity.&ldquo;I literally changed my mind last night. I had thought I would do a short creative arts course and work with my mother but had a last-minute change of mind,&rdquo; said Pillay.Pillay&rsquo;s mother, Vicky Pillay, said although it was not ideal for her to be standing in the heat, she did not mind as long as she manages to get her son space to study.There were more lines at the Durban University of Technology Riverside campus with students desperately seeking spaces to study.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like public relations management. It was never my intention to study it but I honestly don&rsquo;t have many options,&rdquo; said Sbusiso Shoba who was standing in a queue to apply for the PRM course. Shoba said he did not apply via CAO because he could not afford it.&ldquo;I delayed because I could not afford it and when I checked again the prices had gone up to R400 for late applications,&rdquo; he said. Shoba said ideally he wants to study nursing.&ldquo;I only have 25 points and apparently you need 25 points for PR so I have my fingers crossed,&rdquo; said Shoba.His friend, Sfiso Bekwa, was also hoping to be accepted into the PRM course with his 24 points. &ldquo;I really hope they accept my application as I have nothing to fall back on,&rdquo; said Bekwa, who also said he did not apply through the CAO due to not having money. He said he did apply to private colleges but will not be going there because they are too expensive for him.Attempts to get hold of UKZN spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka were unsuccessful on Tuesday.However, Seshoka was quoted in Monday&rsquo;s Witness newspaper encouraging students to apply online while there is still time.&ldquo;We will not be taking additional numbers as the classes of first years that we have can only accommodate 8 700 first-year undergraduates,&rdquo; said Seshoka.
