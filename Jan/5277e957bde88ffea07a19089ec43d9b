More than 8 000 arrests were made on the roads nationwide this festive season according to the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC).KZN RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said these arrests stemmed from an array of traffic violations and criminal behavior across the country including drunken driving, reckless driving, speeding and overloading.&nbsp; He said that KwaZulu-Natal was ranked as having had one of the highest numbers of accidents in the country.ER24 reported several accidents in KZN over the past weekend including two fatalities in Impendle on Friday afternoon when a goods truck overturned on the R617. According to an ER24 press release the truck had carried three passengers including an elderly woman and her daughter and although local police were on the scene for further investigations it was believed that the driver losing control of the truck was the cause of the crash. ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said the man was declared &ldquo;dead on scene&rdquo; while the elderly woman died in hospital. &ldquo;En route to hospital, the elderly patient&rsquo;s vital signs diminished and CPR efforts were immediately initiated, but unfortunately after 20 minutes, no vital signs returned and the woman was declared dead at hospital,&rdquo; said Vermaak adding that the daughter remained in a critical condition in hospital.KZN RTMC said on Monday that the roads were still &ldquo;very busy,&rdquo; as motorists moved out of KwaZulu-Natal into Gauteng from the early morning. Zwane said traffic levels were highest in the morning and although the numbers subsided by the afternoon they were expected to remain high until late last night. &nbsp;He said the N3 recorded between 1 500 to 1 800 vehicles per hour.Zwane added that although the roads were busy, traffic was manageable as the amount of holidaymakers making their way back to Gauteng this year was split between the past two weekends. &ldquo;Some people left KwaZulu-Natal last weekend after Christmas and others are leaving now after the New Year&rsquo;s [long weekend] so at least traffic is more manageable this year, but we still urge motorists to be safe, and not to speed. It is better to be a few hours late than to be dead on arrival,&rdquo; said Zwane.
