Pietermaritzburg - A shack erected on the roadside on Burger Street has residents concerned that there may be more to come.The corrugated sheet shack that was delivered on a flatbed tow-truck on Saturday soon caught the eyes of many after a &ldquo;Themba&rsquo;s Tuckshop&rdquo; sign appeared above it.Burger Street resident Tariq Osman said the shack had become &ldquo;quite an eyesore&rdquo; in the area with alleged prostitutes and vagrants &ldquo;hanging around the structure&rdquo;.Osman said he approached the owner of the tuckshop, who said the structure was temporary and would be removed on Monday this week.&ldquo;It still has not been removed,&rdquo; he said.Osman said he looked into the structure and found a mattress in it.&ldquo;The main concern for us is safety. With one shack being placed here, in about a month we may find the entire roadside filled with shacks,&rdquo; Osman said.He added that while he was at work, his wife was alone at home and walked their children to Madrassah.&ldquo;We already have a problem with prostitution in the area. The last thing we need now is to add to the issues that we are already faced with.&rdquo;He said the social issues plaguing their suburb leave them with sleepless nights.Osman&rsquo;s family have lived in the area for almost 20 years and he said they had watched their suburb &ldquo;deteriorate&rdquo; over the years.&ldquo;We also cannot leave our homes or allow our children to play outside. We cannot invite people to our home,&rdquo; he added.Ward councillor for the area Uraisha Haswell said many of the residents reported the incident to her when the shack was delivered over the weekend.Haswell said there was no proper consultation with her or the residents to allow for the tuckshop to be built on the roadside.&ldquo;I have reported the matter to the police and the Speaker&rsquo;s office to investigate,&rdquo; she said.Questions to acting municipal spokesperson Siyabonga Hlongwa were not answered by the time of going to print.
