Ever since his ancestors taught him how to sculpt a springbok in his dream, a man from KwaNoshezi, upper Edendale, has been using his new-found talent to sculpt many other animals.David &ldquo;Watt&rdquo; Cele (52) said he started creating animal statues two years ago after his ancestors &ldquo;blessed him with a new talent&rdquo;.&ldquo;I had a dream of my forefathers instructing me to create a sculpture of the springbok on the R1 coin. They told me that is how I would be able to make money working from home,&rdquo; said Cele.The bubbly man, who lives alone in a small creatively painted house, said he used to be a machine operator at a metal factory but is no longer employed, and his only source of income is his government grant.To create his artwork, Cele said he welds iron into a skeleton shape of the animal he wants. He then moulds the body of the animal using a mixture of cement and sand. When it is dry he uses the fabric used to mend car bonnets to create a smooth surface and paints it.&ldquo;No one taught me to mould these sculptures, I dreamt it, then woke up and went to different shops in town and asked what materials I could use,&rdquo; said Cele.He said sometimes his friends offer to help him with his works but eventually leave because he has no money to pay them. &ldquo;The material and paints I use are very expensive and I would appreciate any support I could get,&rdquo; he said.The sculptor said he has never sold any of his sculptures because people do not know about them.&ldquo;I am just an old man using my talent to make a difference. I plead with people to support me by buying my sculptures,&rdquo; he said, adding that he is willing to create any other sculptures based on his customers&rsquo; requests.He said he plans to create a huge elephant sculpture soon that will symbolise the area of uMgungundlovu.
