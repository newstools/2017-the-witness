Pietermaritzburg - If you have watched the hilarious video of a Kulula flight attendant delivering the safety demo with a South African twist, then you may be happy to know he hails from the Zulu Kingdom.Originally from Pietermaritzburg, Adrian Thomas hit international stardom when the video went viral on social media this week.Frequent flyers will agree they pay hardly any attention to the usually dull safety demonstration, but with Thomas at the microphone, everyone on board was laughing out loud.Speaking to&nbsp;Weekend Witness on&nbsp;day, Thomas said the video was taken in 2013 when he was still employed by the airline.The friend who recorded the hilarious video initially posted a short clip on YouTube, which received 600 000 views.Thomas said he then posted the full clip on YouTube, but it only received about 50 000 views.&ldquo;All of a sudden on Sunday, a guy named Abu Kad shared the entire video on Facebook and it just went viral from there,&rdquo; Thomas said.He said he has since received calls from media houses in London, Australia, Dubai, the Netherlands, Mauritius and the U.S.&ldquo;I am quite overwhelmed by the response this video has received so many years later. I guess I did not even realise how big this is,&rdquo; he said.In the video, Thomas narrates the safety demonstration in different South African and British accents leaving the passengers on board in stitches.&ldquo;I come from an entertainment-orientated family with my father being a musician and also a joker.&ldquo;I picked up the accents while travelling,&rdquo; he said.Thomas is also a professional dancer and choreographer and a sportsman.&ldquo;It has always been my nature to make sure everyone was okay. These passengers&rsquo; lives are in our hands when they board a flight so it is our responsibility to make them feel comfortable,&rdquo; he said.He added that for many, it may have been their first flight so he wanted to give everyone an experience they would not forget.&ldquo;I was one of the lucky passengers on one of your flights and you are brilliant,&rdquo; reads Mich Lindner&rsquo;s comment on the YouTube video.Yasmin Rajah said she was also on the same flight. &ldquo;I was on a flight with this one. Almost pee&rsquo;d myself. Was so funny,&rdquo; she wrote on Facebook.&ldquo;I love the way the South Africans can laugh at themselves,&rdquo; wrote Ruth Levy.A flight attendant for about six years, Thomas said he eventually left Kulula and is now the assistant manager at Bidvest McCarthy Pre-Owned Sandton.Born and raised in Northdale in Pietermaritzburg, Thomas attended Union Park Primary and Woodlands Secondary schools.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always be a PMB boy. I can never forget my roots,&rdquo; he said.Kulula marketing manager Bridgette Ramuluvhana said the airline was always about making air travel &ldquo;a fun and enjoyable experience&rdquo;.&ldquo;So we are glad to see that social media users are sharing Adrian&rsquo;s love for his job. Safety is always our priority, and his light-hearted take on the safety demonstration is a great way to remind people of that,&rdquo; Ramuluvhana said.&ldquo;Now if you don&rsquo;t know the passenger next to you, introduce yourself to them quickly. You never know you might get lucky in Jozi on a Thursday.&rdquo;&ldquo;Now if you&rsquo;re on board with your lover, gentlemen, and you&rsquo;ve just spotted your skelmpie sitting a few rows away from ya, you&rsquo;d be pleased to know that there are eight emergency exits doors on this aircraft and the crews doing to point them out to you now.&rdquo;&ldquo;Awe, Kulula travellers, Gatipi here from Mitchell&rsquo;s Plein, hoesit. Designer Gucci lifejackets are beneath your seat hey. On instruction from the crew you grab it and pull it over your heads. Fasten the tape tightly around your waist and watch your partner&rsquo;s neck as you may survive the landing. Once you&rsquo;re ready to leave you pull down on this red thing here, it&rsquo;s going to give you the new Wonderbra look. If your boat don&rsquo;t float there&rsquo;s a manual inflation tube I suggest you start pumping, as well as a light to keep you in contact or to shine in the shark&rsquo;s eye and not the Blue Bull&rsquo;s. We&rsquo;re going to ask all those passengers who can swim to assemble to the left hand side of the aircraft, for those of you who cannot swim, thank you for flying Kulula.com.&rdquo;&ldquo;Now folks, if you&rsquo;re travelling with your kiddies, please ensure they are well behaved, if not, we are going to ask them to play outside.&rdquo;
