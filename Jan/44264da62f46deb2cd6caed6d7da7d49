While many residents may have been astounded at some of the big bangs exploding in neighbourhoods over New Year, there has been a huge improvement in terms of the effect of fireworks on animals this year compared to other years. According to Pietermaritzburg SPCA manager Ronnie Yeoman, only five dogs were brought into the SPCA on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, far less than last year&rsquo;s alarming 30. Yeoman said no injuries were reported, which is a refreshing first for the SPCA. &ldquo;Last year New Year&rsquo;s Eve was a warzone and the fireworks usually start quite early and last throughout the night. We usually get a lot of animals being brought in, some injured, but thankfully the situation was much better this year,&rdquo; said Yeoman.Yeoman added that the SPCA was open on New Year&rsquo;s Eve and patrols were conducted as usual but unlike last year when they could only leave their offices after 4.30 am on New Year&rsquo;s Day, this year fireworks had quietened down by 1 am. &ldquo;Aside from the odd cracker here and there we only heard explosive fireworks from midnight to about 12:30 and we could leave the office early because it was dead quiet,&rdquo; said Yeoman.Yeoman said she was unsure what the fewer incidents could be attributed to but hoped it meant people were now &ldquo;more educated&rdquo; in terms of fireworks and their impact on animals. On Saturday, The Weekend Witness reported the municipality&rsquo;s plea to the public to abide by the strict municipal by-laws concerning the discharge of fireworks. &ldquo;I think the article may have helped and people are becoming more educated about the use of fireworks. It could also be because most people didn&rsquo;t have any money this year to spend on fireworks, but I hope this trend will continue,&rdquo; said Yeoman. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
