Pietermaritzburg performer and dance instructor Bonwa Mbontsi (27) sees our growing city as &ldquo;a gold mine&rdquo; of creative potential.&ldquo;I grew up in Richmond but I have lived in Pietermaritzburg for just over a decade.&ldquo;I went to Maritzburg College and in Grade 11, I tried out for the production Millennium Funk.&ldquo;I did not think I would make it but I did and the dancing bug bit me and I trained as a contemporary dancer with some classical background.&ldquo;Pietermaritzburg is a small town, but it is charming with a lot of space, artistically speaking, to find yourself. With its arts and culture and history, this city is a gold mine. It has so much potential and it is sad to see people leaving.&ldquo;I was trained by Diane West and then invited by her to help teach BalletRIP, which uses the concept of ballet as fitness. It is revolutionary and a great initiative.&ldquo;What I love about dancing is that it is a fundamentally human form of self expression and brings people together.&ldquo;People use dance as a creative channel and a safe space for self expression.&ldquo;I teach dancing through an NGO at Slangspruit and Melmoth. It&rsquo;s one of my joys. It&rsquo;s my pride and my passion. It transformed my life and gave me hope. You&rsquo;re able to help find platforms for children to perform at and publically display what they have learnt about.&ldquo;People are going toward theatre and drama more as mundane jobs are a threat because they are the beginning of automation.&ldquo;I want to break the stigma attached to dancing for boys. There&rsquo;s a lack of understanding about that. The new generation is embracing artistic expression more.&ldquo;As an artist, people may go to Johannesburg or another big city to try and make it, where it is busy all the time, and everything has been established.&ldquo;Here it is all uncharted territory and there is so much to be discovered artistically.&rdquo;
